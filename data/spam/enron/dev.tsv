[ pinion , richard ] to restate the question for clarity , in path manager a scheduler pulls down a supply , market and a service , adds any up / downstream contract information and / or duns or drn override and then saves it . unify looks for an old path with those exact variables and if it finds it re - uses it and if it does not find an exact match creates a new path and path id . i had been told that to do away with this function would create an unacceptably high amount of paths since any path once nominated on could not be deleted . has this changed ? ? ? at one time there were some schedulers that looked for the same path / activity number match for nominations . texas eastern was the only pipeline that needed the old activity numbers no matter how long it had been since they were used . i spoke with chris ordway and the new link system no longer needs this to occur . transco uses activity numbers but uses the activity number cross reference table to that function and therefore should not be affected . therefore , if it does not create a space or memory problem for unify , i don ' t think that this constant old path look up is needed . [ kinsey , lisa ] get rid of this . 2 ) the scheduling position window : does anyone use this ? if not , we ' ll remove the code logic that populates this window . i have never seen a scheduler use this . please verify . [ pinion , richard ] originally such a window was in use by everyone in the legacy system "" autonoms "" so it was duplicated in unify by request . it is not used in unify now because of the other sophisticated tools unify provides which obviate it ' s use . the only value would be notification of bridge errors or contract imbalances but there are other ways to determine those problems . as voted on in a previous meeting of the managers - lose it ! [ kinsey , lisa ] why is this still here ? 3 ) on the inventory pool list , does anyone need to see the contarct references list ? again , this code is called every retrieval time and doesn ' t appear to be used from my observations . if they do need this information , we could provide it , but if not , i ' d prefer to remove the functionality . [ pinion , richard ] this function is still very much in use by those with point based pipelines that must use the imbalance pool to facilitate balancing nomination volumes where multiple pipeline external pools exist and are pathed through the same contract imbalance pool . keep it ! [ kinsey , lisa ] yes . we use this functionality a lot when pathing pools . 4 ) when pathing a one to many or many to one set of paths , what ' s the average number of paths they create at one time ? what about updates ? i know that anr and nigas are big users of this feature since they have small packages of gas that they are limited in size to . does the system seem faster when you update one record at a time or chunks of records ? my real question is how often they do this and for what number of paths on both updates and inserts . by update , i mean , going to the path list and changing an upstream / downstream contract or a psna which in turn forces a new path to be created . [ pinion , richard ] this one to many or many to one pathing goes on every day on every pipeline . there is no ' average ' . they typically update a path with up / downstream meters or duns or dnb numbers one at a time however . i hope this answers your question . i see no change to this process at this time [ kinsey , lisa ] on some pipes this function is used more than others . when it is used we try and do as many paths as possible . at this time i do not see a need to change this process . 5 ) on brokered paths , do you want to utilize the same logic we have for service ? in other words , when updating brokered arrangements , we don ' t incorporate the same logic for zeroing out the path and recreating a new arrangment link and hence sending it to be renominated ? why do we do this for service ? is it because we have to renominate it ? i assume that ' s what it ' s for since we don ' t send brokered paths to the pipe . anyway , with the nomlogic implmentation ( two way interface ) , we were planning on having it behave the same way as service . we need this verified . [ pinion , richard ] we don ' t perform the same logic for brokered paths because these are not nominated to the pipeline and hence do not need a zero path to be resent to the pipeline when a significant change is made to the already nominated path . i don ' t see a need to change the way brokered paths are behaving at this time . [ kinsey , lisa ] agree with richard ."	0

"Subject: big cowboy - additional production tom did some footwork and questioning and determined where the additional big cowboy production is coming from . apparently , hpl cut a deal to purchase this gas at "" hpl meters "" at rocher and big cowboy # 2 , so the gas had been pathed on the gathering agreement into our pipe . all along , these volumes have been flowing into the gepl / big cowboy system and on to king ranch . tom and i spoke with clem about the most correct way to reflect the physical and determined that a transport usage ticket needed to be put into place , as im wellhead , to transfer the volumes from hpl to gepl and into the plant . we unpathed the gathering agreement and brokered the hpl purchase to the tu tickets and moved the gas on our transport on gepl to the plant , effective april 1 . this resolves our overproduction issues for april and forward . please let me know if you have any further questions , comments , or information to add . mary"	0

to let all of you know how you will be charged for analysts if you currently have or will have one in your rc for the year 2000 . the analyst program is being handled differently than it was in 1999 . in addition to the normal salary , benefits and payroll taxes , you will also be charged an overhead administration fee for the program . you will be charged the following monthly amounts for each analyst in the detail class code that i have indicated below : detail class description amount 1 salaries and wages $ 4 , 000 552 benefits 774 557 payroll taxes 360 820 corporate services 1 , 266 total monthly cost $ 6 , 400 the $ 4000 amount represents an average of all analyst salaries and does not indicate what the analyst in your rc is paid . this amount will not change in february as the $ 4000 already includes merit raise information for 2000 . the $ 1266 represents the overhead costs of administering the program , including campus recruiting and office visits . when you look at your rc report , you will see a line item labeled "" a and a reclass "" in each of the detail classes identified above . enron north america is invoiced by corp . for the costs of all analysts . financial operations makes a manual journal entry each month to charge the appropriate rc . please check your january 2000 rc report and make sure you were properly charged for the correct number of analysts you have currently . if there are any errors , please let me know as soon as possible so that i can work with brian heinrich to have it corrected in february . please continue to check your rc report each month going forward . thanks . if you have any questions , please call me . lisa cousino x 3 - 6343"	0

Subject: re : fuel application of the fuel retained from transportation and treating contracts doesn ' t have to be done by zone or compressor , in fact i am sure there will be times when we are either short or long compressor fuel when compared to the pipelines total usage . usually , short . i just do not think the market will let me lay off all of this risk . it would be really nice if we could get the system to track compressor fuel used to service specific contracts but i am afraid it will always be a facility planning issue . fuel should not cause imbalances on the transportation contract . a pipeline could be long fuel due to not running compression and in that case we would have to inject or hold in linepack the excess . it seems that we would look at fuel on a total basis . michael eiben 06 / 22 / 2000 01 : 09 pm to : brenda f herod / hou / ect @ ect cc : lisa csikos / hou / ect @ ect , daren j farmer / hou / ect @ ect , mary m smith / hou / ect @ ect , rita wynne / hou / ect @ ect , steve venturatos / hou / ect @ ect , pat clynes / corp / enron @ enron , edward d gottlob / hou / ect @ ect subject : re : fuel we need to discuss further . my concern would be that how do we know what % hpl should be retaining at a compressor or zone to make sure we recoup our fuel cost ? also , could allocated fuel cause a contract imbalance ? i think that pipeline operations can handle the scheduling of third party fuel retainage . but , if we retain fuel on ena transports , then we need to come up with a plan to nominate this in marketing operations to houston pipeline . currently , this process is not in place . enron north america corp . from : brenda f herod 06 / 22 / 2000 12 : 35 pm to : lisa csikos / hou / ect @ ect , daren j farmer / hou / ect @ ect , mary m smith / hou / ect @ ect , rita wynne / hou / ect @ ect , steve venturatos / hou / ect @ ect , pat clynes / corp / enron @ enron , michael eiben / hou / ect @ ect cc : edward d gottlob / hou / ect @ ect subject : re : fuel what is the answer ? can the systems and processes handle this ? please let me know asap . thanks . edward d gottlob 06 / 22 / 2000 10 : 57 am to : bherod @ enron . com cc : subject : fuel brenda , as you know fuel is a big risk . one of the things we are trying to do is get the shipper to pay fuel . this would mean we would purchase , transport and possibly sell gas with a fuel percentage as part of the price . can the downstream systems , scheduling etc handle this ?	0

"" it has always been the custom at roane county high school football games to say a prayer and play the national anthem to honor god and country . due to a recent ruling by the supreme court , i am told that saying a prayer is a violation of federal case law . as i understand the law at this time , i can use this public facility to approve of sexual perversion and call it an alternate lifestyle , and if someone is offended , that ' s ok . i can use it to condone sexual promiscuity by dispensing condoms and calling it safe sex . if someone is offended , that ' s ok . i can even use this public facility to present the merits of killing an unborn baby as a viable means of birth control . if someone is offended , no problem . i can designate a school day as earth day and involve students in activities to religiously worship and praise the goddess , mother earth , and call it ecology . i can use literature , videos and presentations in the classroom that depict people with strong , traditional christian convictions as simple minded and ignorant and call it enlightenment . however , if anyone uses this facility to honor god and ask him to bless this event with safety and good sportsmanship , federal case law is violated . this appears to be inconsistent at best , and at worst , diabolical . apparently , we are to be tolerant of everything and anyone except god and his commandments . nevertheless , as a school principal , i frequently ask staff and students to abide by rules which they do not necessarily agree . for me to do otherwise would be inconsistent at best , and at worst , hypocritical . i suffer from that affliction enough unintentionally . i certainly do not need to add an intentional transgression . for this reason , i shall , "" render unto caesar that which is caesar ' s , "" and refrain from praying at this time . however , if you feel inspired to honor , praise and thank god , and ask him in the name of jesus to bless this event , please feel free to do so . as far as i know , that ' s not against the law - yet . "" and . . . one by one , the people in the stands bowed their heads , held hands with one another , and began to pray . they prayed in the stands . they prayed in the team huddles . they prayed at the concession stand . and they prayed in the announcer ' s box . the only place they didn ' t pray was in the supreme court of the united states of america - the seat of "" justice "" in the one nation under god . somehow , kingston , tennessee , remembered what so many have forgotten . . . we are given the freedom of religion , not the freedom from religion . praise god that his remnant remains ! let ' s celebrate jesus in 2001 jesus said , "" if you are ashamed of me , i will be ashamed of you before my father . "" - - - - - - - - - if you are not ashamed , pass this on . . . but only if you mean it . yes , i do love god . he is my source of existence and savior . he keeps me functioning each and every day . without him , i will be nothing . without him , i am nothing but with him , i can do all things through christ that strengthens me . phil 4 : 13 geoff gayle synergy oil & gas , inc . office : ( 713 ) 461 - 6626 x . 113 fax : ( 713 ) 461 - 4475 email : ggayle @ synergyog . com to unsubscribe , write to - unsubscribe @ listbot . com"	0

"Subject: juvenile diabetes foundation fundraising it is my sincere honor to once again lead the enron team in this year ' s juvenile diabetes foundation ( jdf ) walk scheduled to take place on sunday , november 5 , 2000 , at the sam houston race park . i continue to serve on the board of jdf representing enron and will be enron ' s corporate executive for this year ' s fundraising efforts . as many of you may already know , i am an insulin dependent diabetic myself . even though i know how difficult this disease can be to manage with the multiple finger pricks for blood samples and several shots each day , i cannot imagine how difficult it is for a small child with this disease . taking insulin does not cure the disease nor prevent the development of complications ; insulin is simply their life support system and without it they would die . enron continues to be a major corporate sponsor for jdf again this year . jdf is a very efficient organization in which approximately 84 % of all money raised goes directly to research . enron ' s goal this year is to raise $ 225 , 000 and we need your help . enron has been the number 1 walk team for 5 years in a row and we are not ready to give up first place ! we need team leaders , walkers and volunteers to help us reach our goal . the theme for the walk this year is "" knock out diabetes "" and we would like to have you join us for this great event . the walk is truly a blast and we had about 500 enron people participate last year and everyone enjoyed it . if you are interested in volunteering to be a walker or a team leader , or if you would like to make a pledge , you may call any of the steering committee members listed below . if you are interested in being a team leader , please contact one of the following people immediately so that you may be included in the first important and informative training session taking place this week . thank you very much for your support . mike mcconnell steering committee members : blanca bollom x 66091 rachel feldt x 57629 deb gebhardt x 39606 cathy phillips x 36898 john walt x 35379 debbie yates x 35305"	0

Subject: subscribers receive first notice on run - away stocks traders ' monthly alert january pick ( bmxg ) exploded from . 20 to 2 . 07 , a gain of over 900 % in 6 days ( 1 / 18 - 1 / 24 ) ! our next pick is an incredible find that will outperform all others based on their solid numbers , huge sales backlog , $ 2 billion in financing , low outstanding shares , and a deal with chinese government - run companies totaling $ 10 billion ! urgent buy at any price : global environmental energy corp . otcbb - geec current price - 1 . 90 running to - 6 . 00 geec is cbs marketwatch . com ' s # 1 best performer in the dj diversified industrials index in the last 2 months . this is a dow jones industry index that also contains 3 m , ge , and honeywell . we are sending this urgent investor bulletin revealing the most undervalued pick on the otcbb to our millions of subscribers for substantial profits immediately ! geec has experienced a recent spike in price and volume indicating heavy accumulation of shares . this is a sign of even bigger things to come for this emerging world leader in the conversion of waste materials into electrical energy , an industry with such high global demand that it is impossible to assign a value to the size of the market . geec is utilizing the unique proprietary technology of their biosphere process system for the disposal of a wide variety of waste products at 5 to 7 tons per hour , making a major impact on the global waste problem . this profitable and environmentally safe process converts into clean , green electricity such waste materials as municipal solid waste , agricultural wastes , forestry wastes , medical wastes , industrial wastes , sewage sludge , shale oil , sour natural gas , and the huge market of used tires . geec generates 5 to 10 mega - watts per hour of electricity from the waste conversion on a continuous basis which is then sold to replenish the local or national grid . the biosphere process succeeds in filling an urgent worldwide need for cost - effective renewable energy sources and a corresponding universal need to solve critical problems in the disposal of waste . geec has secured international acceptance for a revolutionary product designed to significantly impact the global waste problem while a major push for generating electricity from alternative sources continues to be the hot topic due to shortages and massive power failures . geec just announced a $ 10 billion , 5 - year joint venture with chinese government - operated companies , including yanzhou coal mining ( nyse - yzc , $ 74 ) . the deal is structured to have 1 , 300 geec biosphere systems deployed throughout china to fulfill an urgent need for waste disposal and energy generation , two critical areas for a country with a population exceeding 1 . 3 billion people . as china ' s rapid economic advance continues , a shortfall of 500 million kilowatts exists annually , prompting periodic blackouts in all chinese provinces . geec is in line to profit substantially while providing relief from unmanageable municpal solid waste disposal and simultaneously helping china meet its energy needs . the forecast for geec is crystal clear , and this is just the tip of the iceberg for this emerging worldwide leader where shares should be added immediately to every portfolio . we expect a continuous flow of huge news announcements while shares still represent an uncommon value for a company of this caliber . look for the continuation of strong positive developments that will ignite geec , which earns our highest rating for the most explosive gains on wall street . traders ' monthly alert ( tma ) is not a registered investment advisor or broker dealer . certain statements contained in this newsletter may be forward - looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 . such terms as expect , believe , may , will , and intend or similar terms may identify these statements . past performance is not an indicator of future results . this is not an offer to buy or sell securities . tma is an independent publication that was paid nine thousand dollars by a third party for the continuing coverage and dissemination of this company information . investors are advised to seek proper guidance from a financial advisor or a registered financial broker . investors should use the information provided in this newsletter as a starting point for gathering additional information on the profiled company to allow the investor to form their own opinion regarding investment . investing in micro - cap securities is highly speculative and carries an extremely high degree of risk and may result in the loss of some or all of the investment . 	1

Subject: market watch undervalued report f april 2004 top pick of the month life energy and technology holdings , inc . ( otcbb : leth ) leth receives $ 250 , 000 , 000 in financing to fund the manufacture of the environmentally friendly biosphere process system waste - to - energy units in the united states . first unit to roll - out in new orleans in early second quarter . we are expecting earth - shattering upcoming news leading a strong rally in leth for a company that has announced over $ 100 million in sales orders in the past year , and tops that record - setting achievement by acquiring the equivalent of $ 8 . 62 per share in cash for major worldwide expansion . * * our readers grabbed substantial profits for our march pick * * ushg featured at . 75 reached 3 . 65 in 8 days ! traded as high as 7 . 00 since ! the biosphere process system - soaring worldwide demand : leth is utilizing the unique proprietary technology of their biosphere process system to generate revenue from the disposal of a wide variety of waste products at 5 to 7 tons per hour which makes a major impact on the global waste problem . this profitable and environmentally safe process converts into clean , green electricity such waste materials as municipal solid waste , agricultural wastes , forestry wastes , medical wastes , industrial wastes , sewage sludge , shale oil , sour natural gas , and the huge market of used tires . leth profits from the sale of electricity created from the waste conversion on a continuous basis by generating 5 to 10 mega - watts per hour of electricity which is then sold to replenish the local or national grid . the biosphere process succeeds in filling an urgent worldwide need for cost - effective renewable energy sources and a corresponding universal need to solve critical problems in the disposal of waste . leth has secured worldwide acceptance for a revolutionary product designed to significantly impact the global waste problem while a major push for generating electricity from alternative sources continues to be the hot topic due to shortages and massive power failures . financing of $ 250 million positions leth for astronomical sales : the magnitude of this financing package goes much deeper than the fact that this $ 1 . 50 stock now has accessible capital equivalent to $ 8 . 62 per common share in cash . there are 26 biosphere process systems presently in operation worldwide . the available funding could easily be used to produce 100 additional biospheres . now factor in that the average sale price is $ 7 million per biosphere . we cannot even comprehend what this stock should be trading for with a potential $ 700 , 000 , 000 in future sales with 29 million shares outstanding ! leth stock guidance : current price : 1 . 80 near - term target : 4 . 80 projected high for ' 04 : 12 . 50 leth ' s blue chip partner - fortifying the system : leth is an alliance partner with tetra tech , inc . ( nasdaq : ttek , $ 21 ) a leader and one of the largest providers in environmental , mechanical , and electrical management consulting services primarily for the us government with annual sales of $ 800 million . tetra tech will coordinate the securing of necessary permits , installation , and continuous worldwide monitoring of the biosphere process system for leth . tetra tech is now in the process of obtaining department of environmental quality permitting for the biosphere process in the state of louisiana . this is a monumental event for leth which opens the floodgates for major project revenues in louisiana while having a parallel effect on leth stock in the form of a huge near - term announcement . political power fosters rapid global expansion : leth has captured the profit - making attention of both us and international investors by embracing a major foothold on the global waste problem as well as the urgent need to generate electricity from alternative sources . this has been accomplished by successfully creating major inroads to all corners of the globe through the political contacts at the highest level from dr . albert reynolds , chairman of leth , who is also the former prime minister of ireland . dr . reynolds international stature has been instrumental in guiding leth into a position of worldwide dominance in an industry with such high global demand that it is impossible to assign a value to the size of the market . uncommon value for a company of this caliber : we are witnessing a breakout year in the making judging by the frequency of recently announced sales contracts for the biosphere , the impressive backlog of over $ 100 million in sales orders , and the company ' s very solid financial position . we view this perfectly timed convergence of events as the catalyst for additional contracts that will perpetuate the shattering of the company ' s own sales records . as our top stock pick for april , we anticipate the continuation of strong positive developments that will ignite leth shares which carry our highest rating for short - term trading profits followed by robust long - term capital gains . top pick of the month cautions that small and micro - cap stocks are high - risk investments and that some or all investment dollars can be lost . we suggest you consult a professional investment advisor before purchasing any stock . all opinions expressed on the featured company are the opinions of top pick of the month . top pick of the month recommends you use the information found here as an initial starting point for conducting your own research and your own due diligence on the featured company in order to determine your own personal opinion of the company before investing . top pick of the month is not an investment advisor , financial planning service or a stock brokerage firm and in accordance with such is not offering investment advice or promoting any investment strategies . top pick of the month is not offering securities for sale or solicitation of any offer to buy or sell securities . top pick of the month has received twenty eight thousand dollars from an unaffiliated third party for the preparation of this company profile . since we have received compensation there is an inherent conflict of interest in our statements and opinions . readers of this publication are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements , which are based on certain assumptions and expectations involving various risks and uncertainties , that could cause results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking statements . hfu ke hg y dc lfl fuz wwolytile zoxqmrvko kgst glkdss tqagfgexdcnv eka 	1

Subject: await your response dear partner , we are a team of government officials that belong to an eight - man committee in the presidential cabinet as well as the senate . at the moment , we will be requiring your assistance in a matter that involves investment of monies , which we intend to transfer to your account , upon clarification and a workable agreement reached in consummating the project with you . based on a recommendation from an associate concerning your integrity , loyalty and understanding , we deemed it necessary to contact you accordingly . all arrangements in relation to this investment initiative , as well as the initial capital for its take off has been tactically set aside to commence whatever business you deemed fit , that will turn around profit favourably . we request you immediately contact us if you will be favorably disposed to act as a partner in this venture , and possibly will afford us the opportunity to discuss whatever proposal you may come up with . also bear in mind that the initial capital that we shall send across will not exceed $ 13 , 731 , 000 , 00 usd ( thirteen million seven hundred and thirty one thousand united states dollars ) so whatever areas of investment your proposal shall cover , please it should be within the set aside capital . in this regard , the proposal you may wish to discuss with us should be comprehensive enough for our better understanding ; with special emphasis on the following : 1 . the tax obligationin your country 2 . the initial capital base required in your proposed investment area , as well as ; 3 . the legal technicalities in setting up a business in your country with foreigners as share - holders 4 . the most convenient and secured mode of receiving the funds without our direct involvement . 5 . your ability to provide a beneficiary / partnership account with a minimal deposit , where we shall transfer the funds into subsequently . another area that we wish to explicitly throw more light on , is the process we have conceived in transferring the funds into the account you shall be providing . since we are the owners of the funds , and the money will be leaving the apex bank of my country , we shall purposefully fulfill the legal obligations precedent to transferring such huge amount of funds , without arousing suspicion from any quarter as a drug or terrorist related funds ; and this will assist us in the long run to forestall any form of investigations . remember that , on no account must we be seen or perceived to be directly connected with the transfer of funds . you will be the one to be doing all these , and in the course of transfer , if for any reason whatsoever , you incurred some bills , we shall adequately retire same , upon the successful confirmation of the funds in your account . the commencement of this project is based on your ability to convince us of the need to invest in whatever business you have chosen , and to trust your personality and status , especially as it concerns the security of the funds in your custody . i await your response , sincerely , john adams ( chairman senate committee on banks and currency ) call number : 234 - 802 - 306 - 8507 	1

"Subject: auctions with an incumbent ' s right of first refusal shelley , my colleague , clayton vernon , who has a background in economics , wrote a short summary of arguments against the rofr . we are working on the second approach to the problem : we try to come up with a numerical estimate of the value of this option . the fact that an incumbent shipper has this option has distributional consequences : he has something of value he never paid for . having a numerical estimate of the value of this option could help to argue against it . the value of such an option is case specific ; so we shall rather produce a template you can use for valuation case by case . vince kaminski - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by vince j kaminski / hou / ect on 01 / 20 / 2000 08 : 34 am - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - clayton vernon @ enron 01 / 20 / 2000 08 : 29 am to : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect cc : stinson gibner / hou / ect @ ect , zlu / hou / ect @ ect subject : auctions with an incumbent ' s right of first refusal vince - here is an essay on the issue you are discussing : the adverse economic impact of "" rights of first refusal "" an option to "" first refuse "" to match a competitor ' s offer is a restraint of free trade and an impediment to efficiency in the marketplace . this economic conclusion is unambiguous . if an "" incumbent "" has the right to match an offer made by a competitor , for an item or service of value , then few competitors will invest the time and expense necessary to prepare and submit offers , those offers will be lower than they would have been otherwise , and the contract will often be awarded to an inefficient incumbent instead of a more efficient challenger . in a traditional auction , where all bids are sealed and the item up for auction is awarded to the highest bidder , we can safely predict the item will be awarded to the bidder who values it the most , at a price reflecting the full value of the item up for auction . this is the efficient result in a market economy , because the financing of the high bid reflects resources freely allocated to the high bidder . if the auction has open bids , we can again safely predict the item to be awarded to the correct bidder , albeit at a slightly lower price to the donor of the item since the bidder with the highest valuation can simply increment by an infinitesimal amount the second - highest valuation . now , in a modified auction , where an incumbent bidder has the right to match the highest bid and retain the item for himself , each competing bidder must justify his own due diligence and bid preparation expenses against the following , and likely , scenario : the incumbent does not spend himself for due diligence , but instead uses these savings to help finance his matching the top bid from a competitor . simply put , the incumbent with a "" right of first refusal "" can be safely predicted to simply match their competitor ' s bid by "" rule of thumb . "" but the incumbent ' s valuation of the item up for auction can be less than the valuation of the competitor , by the amount of the due diligence and administrative expenses . and , the incumbent firm expropriates the expertise of his competitors , not only in their valuations themselves , a nontrivial financial exercise , but in any operational details required to be submitted along with the bid . furthermore , in an esoteric concept known as the "" winner ' s curse , "" a bidder realizes that if his bid actually prevails , if the incumbent fails to match it , he almost certainly overbid . given this , most competitors will not even bother to bid in an auction when an incumbent has the right of first refusal , and those that submit a bid do not rationally invest the time , expense and expertise necessary ; they may just "" fire off "" a "" low - ball "" bid . after all , in almost every conceivable "" state of the world "" arising from the auction the competitors expect to lose money . so , the incumbent almost always retains the contract at a below - market price , despite the incumbent not necessarily placing the highest value on the contract because the incumbent cannot put the contract to its most efficient use ."	0

Subject: gas & power marketing & trading study vincent , i enjoyed meeting with you yesterday and discussing our gas & power marketing & trading study . we really hope that enron is able to participate this year and we will work with you to address your concerns . i believe that the problem last year was primarily due to concerns over releasing data in general and not our study in particular . i am attaching an electronic copy of the latest version of the input sheet for the study . it is far easier to read on a computer than in print . please remember that enron does not need to answer every question to participate and that all results are reported back in a blinded format . the only data points identified by company are the data points for the company values of the company receiving the report . if you have any further questions regarding the report , please do not hesitate to call john stephenson or myself at ( 713 ) 523 - 8001 . have a great weekend and thank you for your efforts to enable enron to participate in this year ' s study . sincerely , richard murphy rmurphy @ navigantconsulting . com ( 713 ) 523 - 8001 - 2000 input sheet . xls	0

( b ) how enron is disciplining the internal decision making process with market . this is in many ways the critical aspect of real options that most finance people miss - - having options is one thing but exercising them and realizing their value is another . all of the incomplete contracting , asymmetric information , and incentive issues are ignored in real options valuation models . but they are real in practice . my impression is enron ' s real success is in putting place an organization that is able to mitigate these problems by imposing a market disciplining . ( c ) how enron manages the various books that involve physicals , financials , credit etc . this is specially important when many of the real assets have options features and therefore , include non - linear risk profiles . the story of gas is pretty well understood but not many of the others markets enron has been moving into over the last few years . on the gmii front , i think that some interesting opportunities arise when you think of the spectrum in a way similar to that of dark fiber . i am working with several people at lucent on this issue . i think it would be wonderful to engage in a conversation with enron and lucent folks in the room . i can do a lunch time talk on any of these issues . perhaps we can discuss some of these over a conference call . clearly , having vince kaminski in the room would be very important to me . as for schedules , the first 3 weeks of april are horrible . april 26 / 27 , may 3 / 4 are good for me . regards nalin at 06 : 56 pm 03 / 22 / 2001 , mack , iris wrote : > hi , > > as we briefly discussed , i spoke with one of my colleagues ( dr . > martin lin ) about your visiting enron to give a talk and to spend some > time with us to discuss you work in telecommunications , real options , > etc . > > martin and i are working on various broadband related problems . > > we thought it might be helpful if you let us know a bit more about > the following : > * when you want to come ( the research group has weekly > catered lunch on thursday and brown bag lunches on every other friday ) . > > * a description of what you want to talk about with respect > to telecoms , broadband , etc . > * who you would like to meet with me - vince kaminski ( our > boss ) , any other of our colleagues in research , broadband , etc . > . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . etc . > > > > > look forward to hearing from you . > > regards , > iris"	0

Subject: floating lng terminal folks , as a follow - up to scott neal ' s inquiry this morning concerning portable / floating lng opportunities for california , i have learned that no such capability currently exists . according to todd peterson of enron global lng , exploitation of this opportunity has been the topic of some industry articles but no one , as far as we know , has constructed such a vessel . i did come across a proposed design for an lng floating terminal by the italian company , tecnomare . i contacted them and they indicated that they have not built such a vessel . it is estimated that construction of such a vessel would take 2 - 3 years , and as one might imagine , achieving the required operational and environmental performance in such a vessel would be quite substantial . attached is a link to a relatively brief description of the proposed vessel , please let me know if any further research is needed . charlie weldon	0

Subject: patricia tlapek brad , as per our previous discussions , vince wanted me to give you the background on our request to bring patricia tlapek into the research group at the very top end of the manager group . the justification for this was not only her extraordinary performance in setting up our technical analysis section but also our reliance on her to build this group and expand its scope . this memo is in response to your request today to document our reasoning . this past year patricia was extremely successful in building internal clientele for her products and recommendations - she is now widely relied on by gas , power , crude and equity marketers , as well as traders from the calgary office . in addition , she developed and presented seminars to bring traders up to speed on techniques in technical analysis . also this last year patricia built and populates daily the research group ' s intranet site on technical analysis . as a crowning achievement ( but just the beginning ) , patricia was given the authority to actually trade natural gas as jeff shankman , managing director , authorized her book for technical analysis trading . currently , we are proceeding with the expansion of her group personnel - wise and she is agressively working to gain authority from other groups to trade live books on other energy commodities and energy - related equities . for these reasons , we want to peg patricia ' s salary at the top of the pay scale . thanks for expediting this effort . - - - mike	0

Subject: refined products line - - north american markets - cera alert : decem ber 15 , 2000 cera alert : december 15 , 2000 title : refined products line - - north american markets cera knowledge areas : refined products us margin highlights * responding to falling apparent demand and rising primary inventory levels , us gulf coast unleaded gasoline margins versus wti fell by $ 2 . 26 per barrel to average $ 1 . 45 per barrel during november . gasoline margins have returned to a historically normal range after spending the summer of 2000 at exceptionally high values . cera expects gasoline margins to wti to average $ 2 . 75 per barrel during the first quarter of the new year , $ 1 . 16 per barrel lower than this year ' s first quarter average . * high sulfur no . 2 fuel oil differentials with wti dropped slightly , averaging $ 5 . 97 per barrel in november . despite the drop of $ 0 . 37 per barrel from october ' s average , fuel oil differentials remain at unprecedented values - $ 4 . 20 per barrel higher than a year ago and $ 3 . 46 per barrel greater that the previous five - year average . for the first quarter of 2001 , cera anticipates distillate margins to moderate somewhat but remain at a record high level of $ 4 . 75 per barrel in the first quarter . * jet / kerosene differentials versus wti rose $ 0 . 63 per barrel from the october average , reaching a whopping $ 8 . 59 per barrel in november . in correspondence with the distillate market , jet / kerosene margins are at historically high levels and receiving support from relatively tight fundamentals . cera expects jet / kerosene margins to moderate somewhat in the first quarter in response to seasonal weakening of demand following the holiday travel season but to remain exceptionally strong at an average of $ 5 . 75 per barrel . * margins for us gulf coast 1 % sulfur residual fuel dropped by $ 2 . 15 per barrel , reaching $ 3 . 99 per barrel below wti during november . despite the recent widening of differentials , cera expects soaring natural gas prices to support relatively narrow residual fuel differentials throughout the winter months . residual fuel differentials are expected to average $ 2 . 50 per barrel below wti during the first quarter of next year , at the high end of the historical range . us demand highlights * apparent demand for unleaded gasoline fell seasonally by about 0 . 5 million barrels per day ( mbd ) from the october level , reaching 8 . 36 mbd for the four weeks ending december 8 . demand is averaging less than 1 percent below last year largely because y 2 k concerns helped inflate december demand a year ago . cera anticipates gasoline demand to continue to decline seasonally as colder temperatures arrive , averaging 8 . 08 mbd during the first quarter of 2001 . * reported distillate apparent demand remains exceptionally strong at 3 . 94 mbd for the four weeks ending december 8 , over 7 percent greater than this time last year . this represents a slight increase of about 0 . 05 million barrels ( mb ) from the end - october level of 3 . 90 mb , but still a record high level for early december . with support from low home heating oil inventories , particularly in the northeast , distillate demand has been very strong during the fall of 2000 . cera expects demand to remain strong in the coming winter months , averaging 3 . 79 mb during the first quarter of next year . * apparent demand for jet fuel declined by 5 percent from the october level to reach 1 . 68 mbd for the four weeks ending december 8 . despite the decline , apparent jet fuel demand is over 1 percent above the year - ago level . the relative strength of jet fuel reported demand continues to parallel distillate demand strength with support coming from the use of jet fuel to help mitigate the tight distillate market fundamentals . cera expects the demand for jet fuel to average 1 . 81 mb during the fourth quarter . * reported demand for residual fuel dropped to 0 . 87 mbd for the four weeks ending december 8 , a decline of about 0 . 09 mbd from the october average and a slight increase over the november level . demand for residual fuel is currently 11 percent greater than last year , and surging natural gas prices are expected to result in continued strong residual fuel demand throughout the winter . residual fuel demand is expected to remain in the 0 . 85 to 0 . 9 mbd range during the first quarter of 2001 . us inventory highlights * primary inventories of unleaded gasoline rose to 196 . 5 mb , increasing almost 10 mb from the end - october value . responding to rising stock levels and declining apparent demand , forward supply coverage of gasoline climbed to 23 . 5 days for the four weeks ending december 8 . forward supply is 2 . 5 percent below last year ' s level at this time of year and at its lowest level in the past eight years - although cera still believes coverage is currently sufficient for the level of demand expected this winter . however , cera is looking cautiously at the implications of high distillate refinery yields and production because of the possibility of low gasoline inventories at the start of the driving season in the second quarter of next year . * distillate inventory coverage has remained about level since the end of october at 29 . 2 days of forward supply for the four weeks ending december 8 . despite record high apparent demand , strong refinery production levels helped boost primary distillate inventories slightly , to 115 . 3 mb for this period . primary stocks are 16 percent below last year ' s level at this time and at their lowest historical level ever . although stocks are low , cera does not anticipate shortages to occur this winter . assuming normally cold weather , refinery production and net imports are expected to be capable of meeting demand requirements - albeit at a high price . * jet fuel inventory coverage crept upward by about 1 day of coverage , to reach 25 . 7 days of forward supply for the four weeks ending december 8 . this moves jet fuel coverage above the 23 . 5 to 25 days ' supply range that it had been in for the past four months . the rise of just under 1 day in forward supply was mainly a response to a decline in apparent demand . jet inventories and coverage are expected to become tighter in the coming weeks as the pull from tight distillate markets strengthen , but supplies are expected to be adequate for the winter . * inventory coverage of residual fuel rose by almost 4 days of forward supply from october , reaching 41 . 7 days of forward supply during the four weeks ending december 8 . the increase in coverage was a temporary response to a drop in demand and an increase in stocks . with demand expected to strengthen because of colder weather and high gas prices , cera looks for inventories and coverage gradually to decline in the coming weeks . * * end * * this cera alert will be available in pdf format within 24 hours . this electronic message and attachments , if any , contain information from cambridge energy research associates , inc .

Subject: the lure of the san network world fusion focus : amy larsen decarlo on storage in the enterprise today ' s focus : the lure of the san 03 / 14 / 00 dear wincenty kaminski , today ' s focus : the lure of the san by amy larsen decarlo e - business is changing how businesses value information . information has become a strategic asset that gives companies an edge over their market rivals . companies use intelligence to identify new markets and make contact with prospective customers . in this media - saturated era , information itself is packaged and sold as a product . this makes the ability to supply users with fast access to stored information on a continuous basis absolutely crucial . companies are clearly coming to a crossroads in their storage implementations . with estimates for internet storage capacity needs doubling every three months , it professionals are hungry for a scalable solution to help them consolidate control of stored information . they often look to storage - area networks ( san ) as a better option to manage their information storage systems than distributed models . today , most organizations rely on a distributed storage model that uses file servers to process i / o requests from end users and other application servers . in this model , all requests for data go through the file server that owns the attached storage disks , and only one file server can tap data on a particular disk via a scsi bus . this model has several shortcomings . first , the amount of data a server can access is restricted to the number of disks supported by the bus , which limits the capacity of a single file server . second , because the server processes each i / o request , it risks becoming a bottleneck . third , this server model carries some daunting availability limitations , because only one file server is allowed to access a set of disks . if that file server or any of its scsi connections fails , then users and other application servers lose access to the stored files . this model carries other major disadvantages . distributed file servers rely on the data transport network to run backup and recovery operations which can eat up bandwidth and slow normal network transmissions to a crawl . finally , this decentralized setup is difficult to manage from both a logical and a physical perspective . file server based storage systems are distributed throughout the enterprise , so it is often difficult to assess current and future capacity needs . and because these servers use a parallel cabling scheme to link the file server to the disk array , they can also be cumbersome to set up and manage . sans promise to mitigate the problems that plague conventional file servers , largely through consolidation of control . these specialized storage networks claim higher availability , faster performance , centralized management , and by their architecture , the capability to remove bandwidth - intensive data backup and recovery operations from the lan . this frees up the lan for normal data communications and ensures smoother back - up operations . using high - speed transports like fibre channel , sans offer a high - performance network optimized for moving storage data . sans also make way for new storage implementations like lan - free backup . and , because fibre channel can support distances of up to 10 kilometers , san devices can be widely distributed , but also centrally managed as one network . yet , as was the case with lans in their younger years , sans are still developing . vendors are still working out major product interoperability issues , while companies deploying san technology struggle with how to merge the very different worlds of storage and networks and manage both together . ultimately the hope is that , like lans , sans will develop into a mature and highly manageable solution that supplies substantial benefits at lower costs . given that storage deployment and ongoing support costs can total 10 times the acquisition price for the equipment , the consolidated management capabilities of a san may deliver the biggest benefit to business . to contact amy larsen decarlo : -

Subject: var david , during today ' s var coordination meeting we had a discussion of issues related to mapping of the forward price curves into core locations . mapping is a necessity dictated by the limitations of the computer system : we have to reduce the dimensionality of the problem to stay within the bounds of available cpu memory . also , in some cases the quality of price discovery is poor and it ' s difficult to model the price curves independently : we solve the problem by mapping them into more liquid and better behaved core locations curves . we have agreed on the following : 1 . winston will investigate the it side and determine to what extent we can increase the number of forward price curves that are simulated as basic ( core ) curves . he will investigate the impact of a larger number of the core curves on the time required to complete the var run . 2 . the curves associated with the biggest 10 - 20 positions in each commodity should be modeled as core curves ( i . e . no mapping into other locations ) . it makes sense to monitor the biggest risks separately and avoid aggregating them into less transparent aggregates . 3 . the results of an automated clustering ( mapping ) procedures should be systematically monitored by a human and corrected if they misrepresent the risks of the trading positions . this responsibility should be vested with one person ( right now the responsibility is dispersed through the organization and this means in practice that nobody is responsible ) . research can allocate one person to this task ; cooperation of trading and rac will be critical . vince	0

"Subject: re : working gas price model vince - i have a simplified version of brad ' s model in mind . the "" no arbitrage "" condition equates trading margins across the country . costs of transmission rise with congestion on the network . wellhead supply is almost completely price - elastic , while burner - tip demand is almost completely price inelastic . storage is rationalized as a perpetual call option . the least time - variant parameters are the costs of injecting and withdrawing gas from storage to the pipeline , followed by the costs of delivering gas from the wellhead to the pipeline . the intermediate - variant parameters are the capacity - dependent costs paid to the pipeline ( above shrinkage ) for transmission . the most time - variant parameters are the trading margins and the valuations of the storage option . there are 8 parameters to be estimated at each major node of the betwork . they are identifiable in either of two straightforward ways : using a short time series of the last 3 days prices based on the assumed variability mentioned above , or point - estimates ( "" calibrations "" ) using only today ' s data based on a node - based model of competition between pipelines where pipes with the same region of origination , albeit markedly different terminus , price versus capacity similarly , "" competing "" for outflows . i will write this up for you in scientific word and present it to you at your earliest convenience . clayton"	0

Subject: hurricane warning derivatives folks , this note is intended to update all who may be concerned on our progress toward developing a commercial hurricane warning derivative product or line of products . it is clear that numerous entities have underlying exposures to hurricane warning frequency and / or duration . it is our objective to develop derivative products that will enable these entities to effectively hedge this exposure . we have generated a partial brainstorm - style list of whom natural counterparties might be according to their underlying exposure : pro - hurricane anti - hurricane the weather channel resorts home depot cruise ships lowes riverboat casinos cnn chemical plants and refineries local tv stations u . s armed forces dry ice manufacturers athletic teams chainsaw manufacturers city governments insect repellant manufacturers state governments it is obvious that there are numerous naturally offsetting parties but it is important to note that the pro - hurricane entities are more macro in nature while the anti - hurricane entities are typically more regional . thus , we have documented the frequency and duration data by regional location with the thought that the anti - hurricane entities would be interested in regional products and the pro - hurricane entities would likely be more interested in bundled regional products depending on their exposure . thus far , we have collected and documented all u . s hurricane warning data from 1980 - 2000 in the form of an excel database . the data can be sorted by year , storm , or location on the u . s coastline . total hurricane warning duration as well as number of discrete hurricane warnings are the primary data sets of interest for any given location ( or year or storm ) . the u . s coast has been divided into 11 different geographic regions of roughly similar size . these regions are : new england , mid - atlantic , virginia , north carolina , georgia / south carolina , east florida , west florida , florida panhandle , orleans / miss / bama , lousiana , and texas . while this data set may not yet be sufficient for price modeling purposes , it has confirmed our expectation that hurricane warning frequency and duration is quite volatile and unpredictable . it is believed that this volaility , when graphically depicted and mathematically represented , could be used to effectively demonstrate to would - be customers the impact of hurricane warning frequency on their business financials . in many cases , businesses may be well aware of their exposure but may not have quantified it and certainly probably felt as if this was a risk they would have to wear themselves . as we move forward on the modeling front , the data will certainly need to be scrutinized to correct for any skewing factors such as political trends , satellite availability , population trends , etc . additionally , we need to go further back in time so long as the accuracy doesn ' t decline . on the marketing front , i am certainly open to ideas . it is believed the weather channel would be the most natural party for such a product . given our positive relationship that we currently have with them , they might be the easiest sell . any and all ideas are welcome with regard to how and when we should approach customers . please respond with any questions , comments or concerns on this project . thanks , charlie	0

Subject: london research group john , i am writing to you regarding the management of the london research group . as you know , dale surbey , who was managing the london unit of the research group , is moving to ebs . dale did a terrific job helping me to develop the pool of talent we have currently in london . given that dale is likely to be transfered to houston , it ' s time to nominate one member of the research group for a management position . my recommendation is steve leppard . steve emerged not only as the most technically qualified member of the group but also as a natural leader , highly respected by his peers and internal customers . steve has a very high energy level and is very efficient as a manager and as coach of new talent . his promotion is likely to cause anjam ' s departure form enron . i value technical skills of anjam , but in spite of my loyalty to him , don ' t think he is the same caliber as steve . however , i would not like to lose him and think about moving him to houston for 2 years . i think that the opportunity to work in houston , would be a sufficient incentive to keep him in enron . by the way , his performance feedback has greatly improved . please , let me know what you think . vince	0

Subject: var david , during today ' s var coordination meeting we had a discussion of issues related to mapping of the forward price curves into core locations . mapping is a necessity dictated by the limitations of the computer system : we have to reduce the dimensionality of the problem to stay within the bounds of available cpu memory . also , in some cases the quality of price discovery is poor and it ' s difficult to model the price curves independently : we solve the problem by mapping them into more liquid and better behaved core locations curves . we have agreed on the following : 1 . winston will investigate the it side and determine to what extent we can increase the number of forward price curves that are simulated as basic ( core ) curves . he will investigate the impact of a larger number of the core curves on the time required to complete the var run . 2 . the curves associated with the biggest 10 - 20 positions in each commodity should be modeled as core curves ( i . e . no mapping into other locations ) . it makes sense to monitor the biggest risks separately and avoid aggregating them into less transparent aggregates . 3 . the results of an automated clustering ( mapping ) procedures should be systematically monitored by a human and corrected if they misrepresent the risks of the trading positions . this responsibility should be vested with one person ( right now the responsibility is dispersed through the organization and this means in practice that nobody is responsible ) . research can allocate one person to this task ; cooperation of trading and rac will be critical . vince	0

mail . my phone number is ( 617 ) 492 - 9551 . i graduated from princeton university in 1996 ( mathematics ) , and came straight to mit for a ph . d . in operations management at the sloan schoolof management . in my first three years i took all the required coursework in mathematics , optimization , stochastic processes , etc . , as well as a number of courses in psychology ( at mit and harvard ) . i am working with prof . gabriel bitran , and i am interested in the mathematical modeling of service operations . in particular , i am interested in the interaction between customers and companies ( hence the interest in psychology ) . the ( tentative ) title of my phd thesis is "" pricing substitute products on the internet "" , and i am sending you the summary which i sent to tom gros a few weeks ago that will give you an idea of what this research is about . thanks again , and i ' m looking forward to meeting you and your research group next week . paulo pricing substitute products on the internet objective : to develop new tools to decide pricing policies for goods and services sold on the internet . motivation : this research is motivated by the fact that traditional choice and optimization models are not appropriate for internet - related businesses . the technological innovations associated with the internet brought about an overload of information which inevitably affects the ways in which consumers make choices . furthermore , companies have a great deal of influence on how much information consumers can have access to . the problem of pricing substitute products is an important strategic issue faced by internet companies . consumers usually search for generic products ( e . g . vcrs or computers ) without knowing exactly what they will buy . companies can show different products and different prices to each consumer . this type of flexibility was not available until the internet came about . the problem of pricing substitute products is not unique to the internet . the methodology developed by this research should be transferable to a number of other settings , such as pricing services . services are unique , and there are many cases where customers will only buy one of many services offered by a given company . our model will help companies decide which services to offer to which customers and how much to charge for these services . research strategy : our research strategy is to divide the pricing problem into two components which can be combined to generate optimal pricing strategies . these components are choice models and optimization models . choice models : choice models describe how customers make choices . the management literature draws on two main sources for these models : psychology and economics . the common approach in psychology models is to use what are called heuristic elimination methods . these methods consist of the elimination of options based on the sequential elimination of features until only one choice remains . these methods tend to be very context - specific and do not lend themselves very easily to mathematical analysis . economists focus on utility - maximing models that are significantly more mathematically tractable than psychological models . the most common economic model of choice is the logit model . the problem with these types of models is that they are not very accurate reflections of how consumer make choices on the internet . the first step in our research will be to develop choice models that capture the interactions going on between customers and companies on the internet . optimization : traditionally , the optimization problem consists of maximizing revenue over a certain planning horizon . on the internet , the problem of maximizing revenue still exists , but there is also a need to learn about customers . short term profit is based on sales , but long term profit is based on how well you know your customers and are able to retain them . the optimization problem must therefore include a short term component ( sales ) and a long term component ( learning ) ."	0

"Subject: re : dear navroz thanks for getting back to me . the reason there has been a dialogue ( not , i should point out , with nick , but with shan millie ) , is that my work is of quite a large size , and needs to find an appropriate home . the question is should it go into a compilation book , or somehow be published in the magazine ? i was awaiting some feedback from risk on the best course of action . we were hoping to publish a cut down version in the magazine , and a full version in risk ' s upcoming "" game choices "" book , but i ' ve heard nothing from your organisation until now ( and i fear we ' ve now missed the boat on the game choices book deadline ) . i ' m attaching the full internal enron document for your reference , and i ' d appreciate your thoughts on how best to put the article in your journal . since the subject is highly diagrammatic , i ' m concerned that 4000 words may be too many when coupled with diagrams ! ( it is currently only 6000 words , but is around 25 a 4 pages long . ) if you can give me some guidance on the issue of publishing extensive diagrams as part of the text , i ' ll get to work chopping my work around until it suits your preferred format . shan millie gave me some good feedback on general points of style and clarity in my writing , but incorporating these would actually make the article longer rather than shorter . i think you ' d better look the document over before i do further work on it . i look forward to your response . many thanks , steve leppard enron capital & trade resources corp . from : "" navroz patel "" 04 / 28 / 2000 03 : 25 pm please respond to "" navroz patel "" to : cc : subject : dear steven , my name is navroz patel and i am the technical assistant at risk magazine . i am contacting you with regards to your initial dialogue with nick dunbar . we would be grateful if you could email to both of the addresses below a copy of your ' real options ' article for our consideration . please note that articles must have full references , be approximately 4000 words in length , and the attachment should be in ms word or pdf format . npatel @ risk . co . uk ndunbar @ risk . co . uk ? thank you for your interest . yours sincerely , navroz patel . technical assistant , risk magazine ."	0

"" as seen on national television "" "" making over a half million dollars every 6 months from your home for an investment of only $ 25 us dollars expense one time . thanks to the computer age and the internet , be a millionaire like others within a year ! ! ! before you say , "" no way ! "" read the following . this is the letter you ' ve been reading about in the news lately . due to the popularity of this letter on the internet , a major nightly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of the program described below to see if it really can make people money . the show also investigated whether or not the program was legal . their findings proved once and for all that there are absolutely no laws prohibiting the participation in this program . this has helped to show people that this is a simple , harmless , and fun way to make some extra money at home . and , besides even if you never got involved in the program , the reports themselves are well worth the money . they can help you start and advertise any business on the internet . that is , these reports stand alone and are beneficial to anyone wishing to do business on the internet . the results of this show have been truly remarkable . so many people are participating that those involved are doing much better than ever before . since everyone makes more as more people try it out , its been very exciting to be a part of it lately . you will understand once you experience it . "" here it is below "" * * * print this now for future reference * * * the following income opportunity is one you may be interested in taking a look at . it can be started with very little investment ( $ 25 ) and the income return is tremendous ! ! ! this is a legitimate , legal , money making opportunity . it does not require you to come into contact with people , do any hard work , and best of all , you never have to leave your house except to get the mail . simply follow the instructions , and you really can make this happen . this e - mail order marketing program works every time if you put in the effort to make it work . e - mail is the sales tool of the future . take advantage of this non - commercialized method of advertising now ! the longer you wait , the more savvy people will be taking your business using e - mail . get what is rightfully yours . program yourself for success and dare to think big . it sounds corny , but it ' s true . you ' ll never make it big if you don ' t have this belief system in place . multi - level marketing ( mlm ) has finally gained respectability . it is being taught in the harvard business school , and both stanford research and the wall street journal have stated that between 50 % and 65 % of all goods and services will be sold through multi - level methods . this is a multi - billion dollar industry and of the 500 , 000 millionaires in the u . s . , 20 % ( 100 , 000 ) made their fortune in the last several years in mlm . moreover , statistics show 45 people become millionaires everyday through multi - level marketing . you may have heard this story before , but donald trump made an appearance on the david letterman show . dave asked him what he would do if he lost everything and had to start over from scratch . without hesitating trump said he would find a good network marketing company and get to work . the audience , started to hoot and boo him . he looked out at the audience and dead - panned his response . "" that ' s why i ' m sitting up here and you are all sitting out there ! "" with network marketing you have two sources of income . direct commissions from sales you make yourself and commissions from sales made by people you introduce to the business . residual income is the secret of the wealthy . it means investing time and money once , and getting paid again and again and again . in network marketing , it also means getting paid for the work of others . the enclosed information is something i almost let slip through my fingers . fortunately , sometime later i reread everything and gave some thought and study to it . my name is jonathan rourke . two years ago , the corporation i worked at for the past twelve years down - sized and my position was eliminated . after unproductive job interviews , i decided to open my own business . over the past year , i incurred many unforeseen financial problems . i owed my family , friends and creditors over $ 35 , 000 . the economy was taking a toll on my business and i just couldn ' t seem to make ends meet . i had to refinance and borrow against my home to support my family and struggling business . at that moment something significant happened in my life and i am writing to share that experience in hopes that this will change your life forever financially ! ! ! in mid december , i received this program via e - mail . six month ' s prior to receiving this program , i had been sending away for information on various business opportunities . all of the programs i received , in my opinion were not cost effective . they were either too difficult for me to comprehend or the initial investment was too much for me to risk to see if they would work or not . one claimed that i would make a million dollars in one year . it didn ' t tell me i ' d have to write a book to make it ! but like i was saying , in december i received this program . i didn ' t send for it , or ask for it ; they just got my name off a mailing list . thank goodness for that ! ! ! after reading it several times , to make sure i was reading it correctly , i couldn ' t believe my eyes . here was a money making phenomenon . i could invest as much as i wanted to start without putting me further into debt . after i got a pencil and paper and figured it out , i would at least get my money back . but like most of you i was still a little skeptical and a little worried about the legal aspects of it all . so i checked it out with the u . s . post office ( 1 - 800 - 725 - 2161 24 hrs ) and they confirmed that it is indeed legal ! after determining the program was legal and not a chain letter , i decided "" why not . "" initially i sent out 10 , 000 e - mails . it cost me about $ 15 for my time on - line . the great thing about e - mail is that i don ' t need any money for printing to send out the program , and because all of my orders are filled via e - mail , the only expense is my time . i am telling you like it is . i hope it doesn ' t turn you off , but i promised myself that i would not ' rip - off "" anyone , no matter how much money it cost me . here is the basic version of what you need to do : your first goal is to receive at least 20 orders for report # 1 within 2 weeks of your first program going out . if you don ' t , send out more programs until you do . your second goal is to receive at least 150 + orders for report # 2 within 4 weeks . if not , send out more programs until you do . once you have your 150 orders , relax , you ' ve met your goal . you will make $ 50 , 000 + but keep at it ! if you don ' t get 150 right off , keep at it ! it may take some time for your down line to build . keep at it , stay focused , and do not let yourself get distracted . in less than one week , i was starting to receive orders for report # 1 . i kept at it - kept mailing out the program and by january 13 , 1 had received 26 orders for report # 1 . my first step in making $ 50 , 000 in 90 days was done . by january 30 , 1 had received 196 orders for report # 2 ; 46 more than i needed . so i sat back and relaxed . by march 1 , of my e - mailing of 10 , 000 , i received $ 58 , 000 with more coming in every day . i paid off all my debts and bought a much needed new car . please take time to read the attached program , it will change your life forever ! ! remember , it won ' t work if you don ' t try it . this program does work , but you must follow it exactly ! especially the rules of not trying to place your name in a different place . it won ' t work , you ' ll lose out on a lot of money ! in order for this program to work very fast , try to meet your goal of 20 + orders for report # 1 , and 150 + orders for report # 2 and you will make $ 50 , 000 or more in 90 days . if you don ' t reach the first two goals with in four weeks , relax , you will still make a ton of money , it may take a few months or so longer . but keep mailing out the programs and stay focused ! that ' s the key . i am living proof that it works ! ! ! if you choose not to participate in this program , i am sorry . it really is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you . if you choose to participate , follow the program and you will be on your way to financial security . if you are a fellow business owner and are in financial trouble like i was , or you want to start your own business , consider this a sign . i did ! - sincerely , jonathan rourke p . s . do you have any idea what 11 , 700 $ 5 bills ( $ 58 , 000 ) look like piled up on a kitchen table ? it ' s awesome ! a personal note from the originator of this program : by the time you have read the enclosed program and reports , you should have concluded that such a program , and one that is legal , could not have been created by an amateur . let me tell you a little about myself . i had a profitable business for 10 years . then in 1979 my business began falling off . i was doing the same things that were previously successful for me , but it wasn ' t working . finally , i figured it out . it wasn ' t me ; it was the economy . inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had been with us since 1945 . i don ' t have to tell you what happened to the unemployment rate . . . because many of you know from first hand experience . there were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before . the middle class was vanishing . those who knew what they were doing invested wisely and moved up . those who did not including those who never had anything to save or invest were moving down into the ranks of the poor . as the saying goes , ' the rich get richer and the poor get poorer . "" the traditional methods of making money will never allow you to "" move up "" or "" get rich "" . inflation will see to that . you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life , with "" no risk "" and "" just a little bit of effort . "" you can make more money in the next few months than you have ever imagined . follow the program exactly as instructed . do not change it in any way . it works exceedingly well as it is now . remember to e - mail a copy of this exciting report to everyone you can think of . one of the people you send this to may send out 50 , 000 . . . and your name will be on everyone of them ! remember though , the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach . so my friend , i have given you the ideas , information , materials and opportunity to become financially independent . it is up to you now ! "" think about it . "" before you delete this program from your mailbox , as i almost did , take a little time to read it and really think about it . get a pencil and figure out what could happen when you participate . figure out the worst possible response and no matter how you calculate it , you will still make a lot of money ! you will definitely get back what you invested . any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in . it works ! - jody jacobs , richmond , va here ' s how this amazing program will make you thousands of dollar $ this method of raising capital really works 100 % every time . i am sure that you could use up to $ 50 , 000 or more in the next 90 days . before you say "" no way ! "" please read this program carefully . this is not a chain letter , but a perfectly legal money making opportunity . basically , this is what you do : as with all multilevel businesses , we - build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products . every state in the usa allows you to recruit new multilevel business partners , and we offer a product for every dollar sent . your orders come by mail and are filled by e - mail , so you are not involved in personal selling . you do it privately in your own home , store , or office . this is the greatest multi - level mail order marketing anywhere : this is what you must do . 1 . order all 5 reports shown on the list below ( you can ' t sell them if you don ' t have them ) . * for each report , send $ 5 . 00 cash , the name & number of the report you are ordering , your e - mail address , and your name & return address ( in case of a problem ) . * make sure your return address is on your envelope - in case of any mail problems ! * when you place your order , make sure you order each of the five reports . you need all five reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them . * within a few days you will receive , via e - mail , each of the five reports . save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 1 , 000 ' s of people who will order them from you . 2 . important - do not alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report , or their order on the list in any way other than as instructed below in steps "" a "" through ' g "" or you will lose out on the majority of your profits . once you understand the way this works you ' ll also see how it doesn ' t work if you change it . remember , this method has been tested , and if you alter it , it will not work . a . look below for the listing of available reports . b . after you ' ve ordered the . five reports , take this advertisement and remove the name and address under report # 5 . this person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their $ 50 , 000 ! c . move the name and address under report # 4 down to report # 5 . d . move the name and address under report # 3 down to report # 4 . e . move the name and address under report # 2 down to report # 3 f . move the name and address under report # 1 down to report # 2 . g . insert your name and address in the report # 1 position . please make sure you copy every name and address accurately ! copy and paste method works well , . 3 . take this entire letter , including the modified list of names , and save it to your computer . make no changes to the instruction portion of this letter . your cost to participate in this is practically nothing ( surely you can afford $ 25 ) . you obviously already have an internet connection and e - mail is free ! to assist you with marketing your business on the internet , the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e - mails , where to find thousands of free classified ads and much , much more . here are two primary methods of building your downline : method # 1 : sending bulk e - mail let ' s say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes , and we ' ll assume you and all those involved send out only 2 , 000 programs each . let ' s also assume that the mailing receives a 0 . 5 % response . using a good list , the response could be much better . also , many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs instead of 2 , 000 . but continuing with this example , you send out only 2 , 000 programs . with a 0 . 5 % response , that is only 10 orders for report # 1 . those 10 people respond by sending out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 20 , 000 . out of those 0 . 5 % , 100 people respond and order report # 2 . those 100 mail out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 200 , 000 . the 0 . 5 % response to that is 1 , 000 orders for report # 3 . those 1 , 000 send out 2 , 000 programs each for a 2 , 000 , 000 total . the 0 . 5 % response to that is i 0 , 000 orders for report # 4 . that amounts to 10 , 000 each of $ 5 bills for you in cash money ! then think about level five ! that ' s $ 500 , 000 alone ! your total income in this example is $ 50 + $ 500 + $ 5 , 000 + $ 50 , 000 + $ 500 , 000 for a total of $ 555 , 550 ! ! ! remember friend , this is assuming 1 , 990 out of the 2 , 000 people you mail to will do absolutely nothing and trash this program ! dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone , or half sent out 100 , 000 programs instead of 2 , 000 . believe me , many people will do just that and more ! report # 2 will show you the best methods for bulk e - mailing , and e - mail software . method # 2 - placing free ads on the internet 1 . advertising on the net is very , very inexpensive , and there are hundreds of free places to advertise . let ' s say you decide to start small just to see how well it works . assume your goal is to get only 10 people to participate on your first level . placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response . also assume that everyone else in your organization gets only 10 downline members . follow this example to achieve the staggering results below : lst level - your 10 members with $ 5 . . . . . . . $ 50 2 nd level - 10 members from those 10 ( $ 5 x 100 ) . . . . . . . $ 500 3 rd level - 10 members from those 100 ( $ 5 x 1 , 000 ) . . . . . . . $ 5 , 000 4 th level - 10 members from those 1 , 000 ( $ 5 x 10 k ) . . . . . . . $ 50 , 000 5 th level - 10 members from those 10 , 000 ( $ 5 x 100 k ) . . . . . . . $ 500 , 000 this totals - $ 555 , 550 remember friends , this assumes that the people who participate only recruit 10 people each . think for a moment what would happen if they got 20 people to participate !

Subject: commercialization of nasa technology hey , i thought you might like to take a look at viaspace the cohen report viaspace was founded in 1998 as a spin - off of the caltech / nasa jet propulsion laboratory ( jpl ) to transform technologies originally developed for space and defense markets into profitable commercial enterprises . viaspace seeks opportunities in high growth markets delivering on problems with growing global relevance by leveraging unique expertise not available elsewhere in the commercial world . viaspace sees a compelling business opportunity in the homeland security public safety and fuel cell markets . viaspace target markets are in excess of $ 100 b / yr and growing with a cagr of over 20 % . in the past six years viaspace has created three companies , spectrasensors , qwip technologies and vialogy corp . their websites provide a background on the commercialization of nasa technology , ( spectrasensors . com , qwip . com , vialogy . com ) . the company ' s current focus is on three subsidiaries , direct methanol fuel cell , arroyo sciences and ionfinity . direct liquid methanol fuel cell direct methanol fuel cell corporation ( dmfcc ) will provide disposable methanol fuel cell cartridges for tomorrow ' s fuel cell - powered portable electronic devices such as laptop computers and cell phones . methanol fuel cells ( dfmc ) are expected to replace lithium ion batteries in portable electronic devices . a dfmc can power a laptop for up to 10 hours on a disposable cartridge that costs $ 2 to $ 3 . a smaller cartridge can power a cell phone for up to 3 weeks . we believe consumers will spend a few extra dollars for the convenience of keeping their cell phones and other electronic devices operating . as a disposable product , it generates recurring revenue for dmfcc . the technology is protected by over 70 issued and pending patents . toshiba , nec , sanyo , and samsung have unveiled prototype fuel cell powered products that more than double the operating time over existing battery technology . dmfcc has opened a tokyo office to work closely with japanese manufacturers . arroyo sciences , inc . arroyo focuses on the fusion of radio frequency , nuclear and electromagnetic imaging to deliver information products in transportation , supply chain , security , logistics assurance and first responder safety markets . the micro tracker product enables a wireless tracking for first responders in hazardous environments . this product combines radio frequency identification ( rfid ) tags , wireless digital communications , ground positioning satellite ( gps ) , data for 2 - d and 3 - d geolocation determination , geographic information system ( gis ) and sensor technologies . real - time processing of many high data content inputs is required for the instantaneous assessment of danger . applications include improved safety for fire department personnel in emergency situations , improved coordination of multi - agency deployments and extended operations in hazardous environments . the cobra product uses the imaging and sensing technology to provide early threat indicators for coastal surveillance and public infrastructure protection such as ports , power plants , airports , and telecommunication facilities . real time sensory and image data is processed and software is customized to discriminate between friend and foe . deepscan is a software system that provides automatic analysis of air and seaport cargo containers based on x - ray and gamma ray imaging . arroyo is currently using deepscan for bomb and hazardous material detection in cargo . ionfinity ionfinity has developed the next generation mass spectrometry ( ms ) technology that is 10 times more sensitive than existing ms , with a 10 times increase in mass range . higher sensitivity enables the comprehensive monitoring and detection of biological , chemical and nuclear contaminants . the current market for ms is estimated at $ 1 . 2 billion annually . the compact size and rugged portability will expand the market . new applications include enabling port inspection personnel to detect traces of contraband , epa air quality monitoring and assisting in hazardous material clean up . additional projects under review projects not included in our forecast are ( 1 ) a water purification technology and ( 2 ) interactive radio . the water purification system displays impressive statistics in that it can convert brackish , sewage or industrial wastewater into ultra - pure water . the water system is scalable from house to municipal usage and will last 25 years while requiring minimal maintenance . the interactive radio enables a listener to receive emails or web sites delivered in response to what is broadcast . the radio station essentially receives input from listeners that could enhance advertising and improve vertical market focus . forecasts and valuation we expect revenues for dmfcc will be driven by ( 1 ) increasing wireless usage of computing devices and ( 2 ) the existing need to extend cell phone battery life . we expect revenues for dmfcc will commence in 2007 and grow to $ 195 million by 2009 . homeland security expenditures on airport and seaport security will be a primary revenue driver for arroyo sciences , which will begin to generate revenues in 2005 , and will grow to $ 90 million in 2009 . we expect commercial revenues for ionfinity will commence in late 2007 , and will be $ 10 million in 2009 . beyond 2009 , total revenues will grow at a 60 % to 80 % rate for several years from existing and new products . contracting with existing manufacturers , we expect operating margins will be in the low 40 % range by 2009 . our initial forecasts indicate a fair value range from $ 8 . 40 to $ 11 . 10 based on the projected growth for the 2009 to 2012 timeframe . the graph below outlines our valuation analysis . directors and management dr . carl kukkonen , is the ceo and founding partner . dr kukkonen was director for space microelectronics and manager of supercomputing at caltech / jpl , where he worked for 14 years . prior to jpl , dr . kukkonen was the leading expert on hydrogen as alternative fuel at ford motor company . aj abdallat , coo , and vp of business development has been with viaspace since inception , after working in business development at hewlett - packard and control data corporation . dr . sandeep gulati has been with viaspace since 2000 . during the prior 12 years , dr gulati was head of the ultracomputing technologies at nasas jpl . dr . gulati is the developer of the revolutionary signal processing technology , qri . viaspace overview viaspace was formed in july 1998 with an objective of transforming technologies from caltech / nasa ' s jet propulsion laboratory and other advanced technology centers into profitable commercial enterprises through its strong connections with the advanced technology community . through its three subsidiaries - - arroyo sciences , ionfinity , and direct methanol fuel cell corporation ( dmfcc ) - - viaspace has a diversified high tech portfolio that includes microelectronics , sensors , homeland security public safety , energy / - fuel cells , information computational technology , rfid , e - finance , and mobile e - commerce . viaspace develops proven space and defense technologies into hardware and software products that fulfill high - growth market needs and solve today ' s complex problems . viaspace benefits from important licenses and strategic relationships with caltech / nasa ' s jet propulsion laboratory and other universities research laboratories . the viaspace team has a proven expertise for the successful commercialization of innovations in information technology , physical science and life sciences developed at academic research institutions and national laboratories . the company currently focuses on technologies originally developed for nasa and the us department of defense that have already reached a certain stage of maturity . initial investments in these technologies amount to millions of dollars and many years of rd , enabling viaspace to manage the commercialization process with only a modest additional investment and greatly reduced technical risk . viaspace couples exceptional technology sourcing and validation capability with a demand - driven process of market validation . decisions about technology transfer and product development are based , first and foremost , on market needs . in addition to our internal expertise , viaspace benefits from the domain expertise of leading experts that serve on our scientific and business advisory boards and from an informal global network of researchers , technology analysts , and technology professionals and investors that would be hard to replicate . in the last six years , viaspace and its subsidiaries have secured more than $ 30 million in venture financing and strategic investment . initial investors include hewlett packard , divine interventures , los angeles county community development commission , blueprint ventures , the united company , bioprojects international , forrest binkley brown , american river ventures , and nth power . viaspace has spawned 3 companies : spectrasensors ( www . spectrasensors . com ) , qwip technologies ( www . qwip . com ) , and vialogy corp ( www . vialogy . com ) . these companies , currently at various stages of maturity , are positioned within high growth markets and poised for profitability . today , viaspace focuses its effort on its three subsidiaries - - arroyo sciences , ionfinity , and direct methanol fuel cell corporation ( dmfcc ) - - and on new high technology opportunities . view full report view full report to join market movers mailings press here to find out more . 2400 lincoln ave altadena , ca 91001 safe harbor statement this information is a paid advertisement . any views expressed herein are provided for information purposes only and should not be construed as an offer , an endorsement , or inducement to buy or sell securities . bronks communications , inc .

Subject: good day friend dear friend , my name is salim ibrahim a merchant in dubai , in the u . a . e . i have been diagnosed with esophageal cancer it has defiled all forms of medical treatment , and right now i have only about a few months to live , according to medical experts . i have not particularly lived my life so well , as i never really cared for anyone ( not even myself ) but my business . though i am very rich , i was never generous , i was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as that was the only thing i cared for . but now i regret all this as i now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world . i believe when god gives me a second chance to come to this world i would live my life a different way from how i have lived it . now that god has called me , i have willed and given most of my property and assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as a few close friends . i want god to be merciful to me and accept my soul so , i have decided to give also to charity organizations , as i want this to be one of the last good deeds i do on earth . so far , i have distributed money to some charity organizations in the u . a . e , algeria and malaysia . now that my health has deteriorated so badly , i cannot do this myself anymore . i once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which i have there to charity organization in bulgaria and pakistan , they refused and kept the money to themselves . hence , i do not trust them anymore , as they seem not to be contended with what i have left for them . the last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of ( twenty million five hundred thousand u . s dollars ) that i have with a finance / security company abroad . i will want you to help me collect this consignment and dispatched it to charity organizations . i have set aside 15 % for you . god be with you . salim ibrahim note : please do get back to me via my private email address at ibrahim _ salim @ ny . com becuase i do not want my family to know anything about this project , so i could give you the full details about the funds . please endeavour to get back to me via my specified private email address . thanks for understanding . may the almighty allah bless you abondantly . mail enviado desde el servicio webmail en el sitio | * btw * | call of duty - . . /	1

Subject: immediate reply needed dear sir , i am dr james alabi , the chairman of contract award and review committee set up by the federal government of nigeria under the new civilian dispensation to award new contracts and review existing ones . i came to know of you in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential transaction , which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account . there were series of contracts executed by a consortium of multi - nationals in the oil industry in favor of n . n . p . c . the original values of these contracts were deliberately over invoiced to the sum of us $ 12 , 320 , 000 . 00 ( twelve million three hundred and twenty thousand united state dollars ) . this amount has now been approved and is now ready to be transferred being that the companies that actually executed these contracts have been fully paid and the projects officially commissioned . consequently , my colleagues and i are willing to transfer the total amount to your account for subsequent disbursement , since we as civil servants are prohibited by the code of conduct bureau ( civil service law ) from operating and / or opening foreign accounts in our names . needless to say , the trust reposed on you at this juncture is enormous , in return , we have agreed to offer you 20 % of the transferred sum , while 10 % shall be set aside for incidental expenses ( internal and external ) between both parties in the course of the transaction you will be mandated to remit the balance to other accounts in due course . modalities have been worked out at the highest level of the ministry of finance and the central bank of nigeria for the immediate transfer of the funds within 7 working days subject to your satisfaction of the above stated terms . our assurance is that your role is risk free . to accord this transaction the legality it deserves and for mutual security of the funds the whole approval procedures will officially and legally processed with your name or the name of any company you may nominate as the bonefide beneficiary . once more i want you to understand that having put in over twenty - five years in the civil service of my country , i am averse to having my image and career dented . this matter should therefore be treated with utmost secrecy and urgency it deserves . please you should signify your intention to assist by sending me a reply to this email to state your position on this transaction , if favorable we will take further steps to brief you the full details of this viable transaction . i want to assure you that this business proposal is 100 % risk free as we have done our homework properly . i quite believe that you will protect our interest by taking this deal strictly confidential , as we are still in government service , which we intend to retire from in full honor . kindly expedite action as we are behind schedule to enable us include this transfer in the next batch which would constitute the new quarter payments for the 2002 financial year . thank you and god bless . dr james alabi	1

Subject: letter from : daniel kabila letter from : daniel kabila investment offer . dear , in appreciation of your esteemed contact received through a reliable source and the choice of your country i wish to introduce myself , i am daniel kabila the son of the late drc president laurent desire kabila of the blessed memory . i know this letter might come to you as a surprise but i honestly do not intend to surprise you . i write this letter in respect of my intention to invest the sum of us $ 12 m ( twelve million united state dollars ) with you . i inherited this money from my mother . this money was got through the smuggling and sales of diamond and timber when my father was the head of state . my mother though not her legal wife used her privilege position to engage in the business of diamond and timber since she knows that her survival will depend on how much she can get out of the privilege situation . when my father was assassinated on 16 th jan . 01 by one of his bodyguards lt . rashidi kasereke through the conspiracy of some top army officers that wanted to topple him i escaped to sa because of the fear that i might be arrested by my half brother lt . general joseph kabila the present head of state . actually his mother and my mother are not in the best of relationship because of who among them will be the first lady tussle and this ultimately affected us their children . considering the relationship between sa and my country ' s new government , my mother advised me to leave for sa for security reason , while the funds were deposited with a security company abroad . on getting to there where i have been living since then as a political refugee i am seeking for a reliable foreigner who can assist me in moving this money out for safe banking and profitable investment . honestly i contacted you because i don ' t want to invest this money in here due to my status here as a political refugee . and moreover i wouldn ' t want to take risk because this money is all that i and my mother is depending on because my half brother has seized all my father ' s assets and money and left i and my mother empty handed without knowing about this funds deposited at the security company in abroad so that is why i decided that investing this money abroad should be the best investment for me . i will be honored if i can be given the privilege of investing this money with your help . in view of this plight , i expect you to be trustworthy and kind enough to respond to this distress call to save my mother and i from a hopeless future . and if you agree , i hereby agree to compensate your sincere and candid effort in this regard with 15 % of the total money and annual 5 % of the after tax returns on investment for the first three years . thereafter , the term shall be varied . 5 % for expenses , which may arise during the transaction ( fax and phone bills inclusive ) . when the money is moved into your discrete account , you will be allowed to draw 15 % in your favor , while the remaining 80 % will be invested meaningfully for our future if possible in your area of business and deterrents sectors of the economy in your country which are dividends yielding . whatever your decision is please reach me immediately through my email , and keep this letter tight secret for the interest of my family . best regards , daniel kabila	1

Subject: charity sees the need not the cost . . . dear friend , as you read this , i don ' t want you to feel sorry for me , because , i believe everyone will die someday . my name is mr . reza abdulla , a merchant in safat , in ( kuwait ) i was married with two children . my wife and two children died in a car accident six years a go . i have been diagnosed with esophageal cancer . it has defiled all forms of medical treatment , and right now i have only about a few months to live , according to medical experts . i have not particularly lived my life so well , as i never really cared for anyone ( not even myself ) but my business . though i am very rich , i was never generous , i was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as that was the only thing i cared for . but now i regret all this as i now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world . i believe when god gives me a second chance to come to this world i would live my life a different way from how i have lived it . now that god has called me , i have willed and given most of my property and assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as a few close friends . i want god to be merciful to me and accept my soul so , i have decided to give alms to charity organizations , as i want this to be one of the last good deeds i do on earth . so far , i have distributed money to some charity organizations in the u . a . e , algeria and malaysia . now that my health has deteriorated so badly , i cannot do this myself anymore . i once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which i have there to charity organization in bulgaria and pakistan , they refused and kept the money to themselves . hence , i do not trust them anymore , as they seem not to be contended with what i have left for them . the last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of ten million seven hundred thousand american dollars ( u . s . $ 10 . 700 , 000 ) that i have with a finance / security company abroad . i will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatched it to charity organizations . i have set aside only 20 % for you and for your time and also 5 % as miscellaneous expenses . reply me at your earliest convenience for more directives to my private email address : reza _ abdulla @ walla . com god be with you . regards , mr . reza abdulla	1

"" i waited patiently . i knew boys like to play . they ' d come to me in their own time . on day two , the oldest two were doing summersaults over my lap . the youngest , ben , took a little longer , but yesterday he raced me across the yard thirty times and won every time . the weekend brought back memories of my own childhood . we had such imaginations . in our minds , a tree was a tower to spot approaching bad guys , a big rock became a mountain , a fallen log a space ship headed to the stars . we had toys , but we had to use our imagination , not like the new toys i see my grandkids with . our toys didn ' t talk , and if they did , you pulled a string to make it work . we had blocks to build , crayons to create , trucks and cars to push . they were simple toys that required imagination . i thought about the toys in my garage , the ones i saved , when my children outgrew them . they were simple and needed their imagination to work . mr . potato head allowed them to learn parts of the body and giggle at the funny face with an ear where its mouth should have been . i still have an old plastic phone . it has a dial to turn , a bell that rings when you push a button , and that ' s it . it doesn ' t talk , squawk , beep or move around the room . it ' s simple and was used when they played house , nurse , doctor , and secretary . i have a toy doctor ' s bag , with all the plastic doctor ' s tools . i remember all the broken bones , cuts , bangs , scratches and aches my daughter repaired as i lay in her office moaning . most toys today do it all . we don ' t need imagination - - it comes in a box . video games that take us into another world or reality , talking toys , with vocabularies better than most people , computerized toys to teach the alphabet . kids sit and have imagination brought to them . the teaching toys are great , but children tire of them - - it ' s like being in school . when my son was young and tired of his toys , he would come to me and say , "" dad , i ' m bored . "" "" go find something to do , "" i ' d reply . "" i don ' t know what to do . "" "" go outside and find a friend . "" "" naaa ! i don ' t want to do that . "" "" use your imagination . "" "" huh ?

"Subject: california update 4 / 20 / 01 executive summary ? davis struggles to find senate support for socal transmission deal ? only chance of deal going through is a one - time quick vote ; if deal has to go to hearings - it will probably die ? if not transmission deal , legislators will seize assets and seek price caps ? asset seizure would target power contracts , then power plants ; as a result the endless court battles will ensue , but this gives davis opportunity to continue to blame generators and marketers ? bankruptcy for socal is still the most likely scenario , with the qfs or socal itself likely to file if the transmission deal dies or gets amended ? congressional democrats rally around davis and seize opportunity to blame the administration transmission deal and democratic support as governor gray davis scrambles to build support for his socal ed . transmission proposal , one thing is evident ; the longer the deal is exposed to public debate , the less likely it is to pass . in fact , politicians have been so leery of the deal that davis has been unable to locate even one sponsor to introduce the bill in the senate . in the eyes of many democratic legislators ( and all republicans ) forcing socal edison into bankruptcy is looking like a better option than buying the transmission lines ; that is why the governor ' s senior strategists have quietly been trying to schedule a quick "" up or down "" vote on the transmission line purchase as early as next week . the bill is currently not scheduled to be voted on in effort to avoid debate , however , if there is an opening within the next two weeks and davis feels he has enough support , it will be pushed through . because the socal deal needs every piece in place as "" negotiated "" by davis ' team , the team wants no amendments allowed on the assembly floor and a quick vote . if this unlikely fast track strategy fails for davis , the prospects for the transmission lines purchase will deteriorate steadily ( keep in mind that that it cannot even be resubmitted to the assembly until it has been vetted by socal edison attorneys ) . according to sources , the legislature is going to try to modify the memorandum of understanding between gov . davis and sce . however , the senate leadership does not believe there will be sufficient support to pass even a modified mou . burton reportedly believes that at least 6 democrats will vote against it along with the republicans . the more that bill gets picked apart in public , the uglier it looks and the more democrats will realize that they are all alone in supporting it . another problem faced by the legislatures is the deal is in favor of socal and not the state . among other things , the state is overpaying by about $ 1 . 5 billion for the transmission lines . additionally , the mou davis has with socal . ed nearly matches , point for point , the deal davis condemned with pg & e . asset seizures since before the pg & e bankruptcy filing , we have maintained that asset seizures through eminent domain would become a major pursuit for increasingly frustrated democrats . davis ' legal office has thoroughly scrubbed the law on eminent domain seizures of everything from power generating assets across california to existing power contracts negotiated by , whom davis ' s calls , "" profiteering power brokers "" . of course , everyone in the governor ' s office understands that any seizing would immediately end up in state and federal courts , and would be a legal nightmare ( there are a few minor constitutional , legal and interstate commerce problems ) . the main thing is that the seizing would continue davis ' s main approach to this problem - - management by press conference - - and it would put the governor and democrats on the right side of the issue - - punishing the capitalist leeches . according to one senior democratic legislator , there is movement within democratic members of the state assembly to demand that davis agree to seize the power contracts in return for their vote in favor of the power transmission purchase . of course , taking the contracts would only be setting a precedent for taking the power plants . the appeal of seizing the contracts is that it would allegedly put california state officials in charge of where the power is sold and reduce mark - ups substantially as they used the contract power authority to provide spot - market power purchases before peak emergency conditions drive the price through the roof . price caps one strong indication as to whether or not summer price caps will occur depends powerfully on decisions made by the three republican governors from colorado , alaska and wyoming . these three were the key players during the portland western governor ' s conference last january and , according to senior white house officials , it took the personal and prolonged intervention of president bush himself to peel these three away from an otherwise unanimous call for price caps from the governors . "" if they had signed that price cap appeal , "" the administration source said , "" we would already have price caps . so if they start to make it clear something has changed , we will have to listen . "" sources indicate that if these republican leaders begin to rethink their opposition to price caps , the bush administration will be forced to reconsider price caps as a remedy for the west . cost plus caps - - think of these as republican price caps in that their first duty is to make sure private companies make money and have incentives to provide power into the affected grid . just to give some idea of magnitudes in a cost plus deal , current discussions would put a cap on power costs at something like $ 250 per kilowatt hour . that is a long way down from the august futures contract that is pricing in $ 750 per kilowatt hour , but a long way above last august ' s $ 150 / kwhr price and a particularly long way above the cost of generating this power , which is something like $ 25 - 30 / kwh . market - price exceptions - - the option allows the bush administration to have political credit for imposing price caps . as we write , ferc is currently , in the process of considering permit renewals for five companies generating power in california ( duke , dynegy , aes , reliant and williams ) . the permit grants a further three - year waiver that allows them to sell power into california in the existing "" whatever price the market will bear "" . in other words , ferc could simply not grant these companies the right to sell energy at the market price , perhaps by changing a definition of controlling market share , and then power to control prices would revert back to ferc . technically , in granting the extension of these permits , ferc has to establish a formal finding that the five power companies do not wield "" market power "" - - that means they cannot affect the price of energy by withholding power at crucial times . of course , ferc has just found on three different rulings in the last four months that the companies wield exactly that kind of ability over market prices and has ordered minor rebates to adjust for the subsequent price spikes . but that would mean ferc would have to want to wield effective power over price capping in california and they have shown no desire on that front . the escape clause for ferc simply to renew the waivers is that they are routinely renewed unless the company applying for waivers controls more than 20 % of an electricity market and none of these companies come close . in other words , the waivers option lets ferc escape if the bush administration and ferc commissioners really want to escape . once again , that decision may be more in the hands of the three republican governors than anywhere else in the country . but you can be certain that in the past few days administration officials have become fully aware of the potential political liabilities of doing nothing except advocating more nuclear and coal power plants . democrats seize opportunity to blame bush senior political leaders now think the total energy bill for the year could come in as high as $ 60 billion , which would destroy state finances for a decade . add to that the constant drumbeat of numbers that voters hear everyday about their own direct out - of - pocket electricity costs ( they paid $ 7 billion for electricity in 1999 , $ 27 billion in 2000 and are expected to pay $ 70 billion this year - - ten times the rate two years ago . then , of course , they open bills with massive rate increases that bring all those incredible numbers home in a very direct way , and , well , who can blame the democrats for saying there is a simple solution , but the white house won ' t allow it . national level democrats realize california ' s power crisis is a prime opportunity to chastise the bush administration and its free - market advocate , ferc chairman hebert , over their resistance to summer price caps . as california ' s leaders calculate this year ' s taxpayer energy bill at potentially $ 60 billion , a rogue ' s gallery of democratic congressional leaders are currently meeting with governor davis and coordinating efforts to fan out across the eight western states of the power grid with a singular message : "" the solution to all western voters electricity problems lies right in washington dc , at ferc headquarters controlled by bush administration appointees . "" and as the political dialogue takes on a more aggressive national tone and its possible impact on control over the us congress comes more into focus , the solutions articulated by california ' s democrats who sense they have republicans on the run in the west become less and less "" free market "" focused . the two strains of the democratic solution that are becoming an unavoidable part of the energy picture are asset seizures and price caps ."	0

2 . it supports further deal flow and potential incentive arrangement income ( along with all the production information etc . ) ; 3 . of even greater importance it provides a very critical and frequently used marketing tool as we continue to build our gas and power businesses across canada . as you know , we have used the petro - canada arrangement as an example of the services we can provide , not only when marketing in canada but also in the us and europe . now we can tell potential customers that we not only have provided services to this customer for 3 years , but they ' ve liked it so much they ' ve already extended the agreement for five more years after the first term - the message has to be that we are providing a good quality of service . obviously this is a great credit to our commercial staff and the operations , accounting and it staff that work with petro - canada . i will separately advise each of the individuals who works on this account about the renewal and congratulate them . it takes alot of effort to "" enchant "" the customer day after day , year after year . in fact it ' s incredibly difficult to be effectively on trial day in and day out as a service provider . the numbers : under the extension , we have provided petro - canada with a rebate applied to the remaining term of the agreement from our original base fee . original base fee is $ 1 . 75 mm cdn per year , payable monthly . rebate offered : jan / 01 - nov / 01 ( $ 458 , 300 ) cdn nov / 01 - nov / 02 ( $ 517 , 000 ) cdn fee charged for extension term : nov / 02 - nov / 03 $ 1 , 366 , 000 cdn nov / 03 - nov / 04 $ 1 , 400 , 000 cdn nov / 04 - nov / 05 $ 1 , 435 , 000 cdn nov / 05 - nov / 06 $ 1 , 470 , 000 cdn nov / 06 - nov / 07 $ 1 , 510 , 000 cdn we have thoroughly defined our back - office costs required to provide these services at $ 428 , 700 cdn / yr ( 2000 $ ) , and have 3 years of operating history to support this as a projection ( with escalation at 2 % per year ) for the second five year term . these costs include back - office staff allocations ( salaries and benefits ) , and rent / infrastructure allocation . we have checked on the allocation of houston costs , and on a per transaction basis these are insignificant compared to our base business transaction levels . we do not include commercial staff costs in the above as they are covered by the incentive arrangement and ongoing transaction deal flow . in discussions with wes , this definition of the costs and certainty about the arrangement scope , will allow us to mtm this income . the mtm income of $ 2 . 9 mm cdn includes the rebate offered for the last two years of the current term , and has been reduced by the above annual costs . notes : 1 . we have not defined the incentive fee for the second five year period yet as we are doing some work at the moment with pcog on what our benchmark should be , given that much of the intermediate producers in the group of 40 have disappeared . we will revise the agreement to reflect the fact that there will be a further revision once the incentive fee is agreed to . 2 . if petro - canada ' s sales volumes fall to 60 % of last years levels , there will be a price reopener for the remaining term because we have defined the fee as an absolute cost rather than per unit rate . we also have a reopener on price if the volumes grow to about 140 % of today ' s levels . petro - canada has a growth strategy for gas so this is not at all expected . volumes over the last 6 months have increased by about 7 - 8 % year on year . 3 . peter and i should have the amended agreement out next week ."	0

"Subject: devil ' s tower update louise , i spoke with tom byargeon this morning while he was at the offshore technical conference . he has spoken with rick fowler , dominion , and plans on visiting him in new orleans next week . the highlights from the conversations are as follows : ? by the end of this week or next , he will have information on two more total depth wells that have been drilled . based on the rumor mill , the reserves associated with the devil ' s tower acreage are looking even more promising . however , nothing is definite until all data is received . ? based on the well data , rick has three financing options : ? negotiate exclusively with a company like enron ? synthetic lease financing with a commercial bank ? rebid ? since dominion is now 80 % owner in devil ' s tower ( bought out mariner ' s 20 % ) , the credit profile of the project looks better . ( pioneer is the other 20 % . ) rick realizes his mistake going with a company that has no equity backing and has egg on his face with upper management . my concern is that based on his experience , he will take the easy way out and align himself with a commercial bank . ? enron has the following in their favor : ? convergent and enron ' s bid were very similar except convergent had aker . ( dominion wanted a guarantee of an aker spar . ) tom has spoken with bob o ' sullivan from aker and he is interested in aligning himself with enron . as such , we can bring aker back to the table . ? dominion wants to spend dollars on "" steel "" for the project by the end of june . as such , dominion will have to make a decision quickly because it will affect whether devil ' s tower becomes an on - balance or off - balance sheet transaction . i think that dominion would prefer an off balance sheet deal . ? dominion won ' t rebid because the other counterparties were not competitive relative to enron or convergent . so , i think our true competition is against a commercial bank for synthetic lease financing . either way , we will have an answer quickly and since the gossip on convergent is out , i think it will stregthen our position on other spar bids ( ie . , medusa ) . regards , mrha"	0

"Subject: fw : bistineau louise , this is the email written by paul bienawski regarding a potential aquisition of bistineau . you had mentioned an interest in seeing this email last week . mrha - - - - - original message - - - - - from : bieniawski , paul sent : thursday , august 23 , 2001 9 : 54 pm to : miller , don ( asset mktg ) cc : mrha , jean ; gregory , paul subject : bistineau importance : high don , this is a long e - mail and i apologize for that but since we have not had a chance to talk , i wanted to send you some information on bistineau as well as the latest output from the storage group ' s m & a analysis . the m & a analysis was just updated as they have been several reservoir transactions in the past few months ( aec @ manchester , atmos @ east diamond , and aquila @ lodi ) . prior to these transactions we did not have enough data points to draw meaningful conclusions about the trends in reservoir acquisition . i have attached the output for your review but i think a couple of points are key . the reservoir curve is "" hockey - sticking "" just as the salt curve did previously . while not as dramatic as salt , the premiums are increasing dramatically . the market is not placing a premium on optionality . salt is inherently more flexible than a reservoir , yet on a deliverability basis , there does not appear to be a significant difference . that may explain why we see players who do value optionality in the marketplace ( aquila , aec , duke , etc ) . these companies have long established asset based storage groups and actively trade around these assets . as far as bistineau is concerned , there are several points worth highlighting . i have attached output from the database maintained by the storage group for your reference . i have not included caverns but we do have that data . reliant energy is part owner of the facility . reliant is aggressively trying to build a merchant storage business . my group has bumped into them several times in the marketplace . since the facility is federally regulated , reliant and koch would be required to make a nga 7 ( b ) filing to abandon the services they provide their customers before anyone could purchase the reservoir . the length of this process would be a function of the number of intervenors . bistineau is a very large reservoir with a large amount of native base gas . how much of this volume is recoverable ( and therefore monetizable ) is a large question mark . relative to its peers , bistineau is a poor performer in terms of flexibility ( low injection capabilities ) koch has , in the past , written off losses at bistineau . the low injection rate may be as a result of this . i have not researched the exact amount of the losses but a seach of ferc filings would reveal the nature and extent of the losses . epps likewise has had some loss problems . if enron ' s intent is to establish a storage asset position in louisiana , south downsville would probably be the best candidate . the field is privately held , under development , has many interconnects , and acquisition would probably meet little resistance given the lack of customers . while i have not communicated with matrix in some time , i do know the principals and could easily get an update on their status and plans . i will not be in tomorrow morning , but should you wish to discuss this e - mail , feel free to call me on my cell phone @ 713 - 825 - 2643 ."	0

"" the market is really shrugging off this news , "" said mark donahoe , a managing director at u . s . bancorp piper jaffray . upbeat earnings news from american express , released monday afternoon , seemed to give stocks an additional lift . investors may be shifting their focus away from concerns about anthrax exposure and u . s . military maneuvers in afghanistan to take a closer look at quarterly earnings results , said steven kroll sr . , managing director at monness , crepsi & hardt . the uncertainty on the global front "" looks like it is going to be a long , drawn - out affair , "" mr . kroll said . "" i think stocks will revert back to being earnings - driven . "" although dismal by ordinary standards , last week ' s flood of quarterly earnings reports got a reasonably upbeat reception from investors , who seem to have approached them with extremely low expectations . "" the markets acted pretty well last week in light of some very ugly earnings , "" said mr . donahoe of u . s . bancorp . that resilience might be giving hope to investors this week , he added . still , investors will be carefully sifting through quarterly results in the coming week to get a fix on how the fourth quarter is shaping up , mr . kroll argued . third - quarter earnings showed several pockets of strength on monday , with big companies such as minnesota mining and manufacturing and u . s . steel posting results that met or topped analysts ' estimates . the dow industrials got an additional boost shortly after 2 p . m . edt when index component american express reported earnings that , excluding certain items , beat wall street previously lowered estimates . the financial - services concern posted net income of $ 298 million , or 22 cents a share , down 60 % from $ 737 million , or 54 cents a share , a year earlier . excluding charges related to a corporate restructuring and the september 11 attacks , american express said it would have earned $ 595 million , or 45 cents a share , for the latest quarter . analysts had been expecting earnings of 30 cents a share , according to thomson financial / first call . shares of american express surged after the quarterly earnings release , closing up 3 . 4 % at $ 30 . 32 . chip stocks helped lead the nasdaq composite higher , with the philadelphia semiconductor index gaining 5 . 4 % . the rally seemed to be a continuation of friday ' s gains in the sector , sparked by positive earnings news from kla - tencor . u . s . steel , the nation ' s no . 1 steelmaker , said it swung to a third - quarter loss from a profit a year earlier , hurt by oversupply and a weak economy . but excluding charges related to the closure of one mill and damage at another , u . s . steel said its loss was much narrower than what was forecast by analysts surveyed by thomson financial / first call . shares of u . s . steel rose 9 . 7 % to $ 14 . 74 . investors also sent 3 m shares nearly 5 % higher after the maker of chemical and adhesive products squeaked by wall street estimates , despite a 21 % decline in net income . and oil producers conoco and usx - marathon group handily beat analysts ' forecasts . but not all the earnings news was cheery . local phone company sbc communications recorded net income that was slightly below estimates . shares of sbc , a component of the dow industrials , fell 5 . 1 % to $ 41 . 40 . meanwhile , the outlook for corporate profits in the fourth quarter seems discouraging , some analysts noted . on monday , 3 m guided wall stret ' s earnings expectations lower for the upcoming quarter , and a top executive at u . s . steel told analysts that the company ' s fourth quarter would be "" difficult . "" companies "" are meeting third quarter expectations , but they are talking down the fourth quarter , "" said mr . kroll of monness crespi & hardt . he said that some of the rise in monday ' s markets might be a carryover from friday ' s buying activity related to the expiration of u . s . stock option and index option contracts , an event known as "" double witching . "" one of the hardest - hit stocks on monday was enron , an energy concern that said that the securities and exchange commission was seeking information about certain complex transactions it undertook with a limited partnership organized by its chief financial officer . shares of enron plunged 21 % to $ 20 . 65 . overseas , stocks closed higher . london ' s financial times - stock exchange 100 - share index gained 1 . 1 % , while frankfurt ' s xetra dax index rose 2 % . earlier in the day , japan ' s nikkei 225 average closed with a gain of 0 . 3 % , but hong kong ' s hang seng index ended 0 . 3 % lower . in economic news , the conference board reported that its index of leading indicators for the month fell 0 . 5 % in september , matching the estimates of economists surveyed by thomson global markets . the index - - a composite of measurements aimed at forecasting likely changes in the economy - - included some data gathered after the sept . 11 attacks . the decline , which was the index ' s largest one - month drop since january 1996 , confirmed that the widespread weakness in the u . s . economy is deepening , the conference board said . falling stock prices and rising initial unemployment claims were two of the index components that contributed most negatively to the september reading . in august , the leading - indicators index slipped 0 . 1 % , less than the previous estimate of a 0 . 3 % decline . even so , the back - to - back declines paint a bleak economic picture , said conference board economist ken goldstein . the two - month decline in the index suggests that the already - weak economy is likely to remain weak into next year , mr . goldstein said . the overall reading from these numbers indicates that manufacturing and services are experiencing a significant slowdown . in major u . s . market action : stocks rose . on the big board , where 1 . 09 billion shares were traded , 1 , 813 stocks rose and 1 , 291 fell . on the nasdaq , 1 . 49 billion shares changed hands . bonds were mixed . the 10 - year treasury note rose less than 1 / 16 point monday , or 62 . 5 cents for each $ 1 , 000 invested . the yield , which moves inversely to its price , fell to 4 . 618 % . the 30 - year bond fell 1 / 16 point to yield 5 . 364 % . the dollar rose . the dollar bought 122 . 56 yen , compared with 121 . 20 yen late friday . the euro traded at 89 . 18 u . s . cents , down from 89 . 84 cents late friday . copyright ( c ) 2001 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . copyright ?

' s shares fell 21 percent after the houston - based company said the securities and exchange commission requested information on partnerships run by chief financial officer andrew fastow and other executives . enron , the largest energy trader , created partnerships and other affiliated companies to buy and sell assets such as power plants to lower the debt on its books . an investor sued enron ' s board wednesday , saying two partnerships cost the company $ 35 million and fastow ' s leadership of them was a conflict of interest . investors today said they were concerned that enron may be forced to dismantle the affiliated companies by paying off the owners in cash or stock . chief executive ken lay said last week he may be have to ` ` unravel ' ' agreements that created the companies if enron ' s debt ratings fall too far . ` ` we need confidence their long - term credit rating won ' t go below investment grade , ' ' said roger hamilton , an analyst at john hancock ' s value funds , which own 600 , 000 enron shares . enron reduced shareholders ' equity by $ 1 . 2 billion when it repurchased 55 million shares of two such partnerships controlled by fastow , ljm cayman and lmj 2 co - investment , the wall journal reported last week . dismantling more of the affiliated companies and partnerships would cost enron or its shareholders as much as $ 3 billion , ray niles , a salomon smith barney analyst , wrote in a report to investors today . enron shares fell $ 5 . 40 to $ 20 . 65 . they touched $ 19 . 67 during the day ' s trading , the lowest level since jan . 15 , 1998 . shares plunge the stock has fallen 75 percent this year amid concerns about failed investments in trading of space on fiber - optic communications networks and a water company , and the resignation of jeff skilling as ceo in august after seven months on the job . while skilling said he resigned for personal reasons , investors say his departure led them to question whether the company was concealing problems , including possible liabilities from affiliated companies . on tuesday , enron surprised many investors when it reported a $ 618 million third - quarter loss , the result of writing off $ 1 . 01 billion in failed investments . moody ' s investors service placed the company ' s debt on watch for possible downgrade . the company ' s debt is rated at investment grade by fitch , standard & poor ' s and moody ' s . the company received a faxed request for information from the sec on wednesday asking for information , spokesman mark palmer said , and will respond ` ` as soon as possible .

' ' shipman said . ` ` investors are worried they might have to share their enron earnings with a lot more people than they originally thought . ' ' worrisome financing enron ' s auditors and attorneys reviewed the company ' s ` ` related party arrangements , ' ' the board approved them , and they were disclosed in sec filings , enron said in its statement . that hasn ' t eased concerns . the reduction of shareholder equity by $ 1 . 2 billion from the ljm partnerships is reason to worry about enron ' s other financing vehicles , wrote niles , the salomon analyst . enron also may take another $ 2 . 4 billion in losses from investments in the dabhol power plant in india and projects in south america , he wrote . enron ' s 8 percent coupon bonds due in 2005 fell $ 34 per $ 1 , 000 face value to be offered at $ 1 , 022 today from $ 1 , 056 on friday , traders said . yield on the debt rose to 7 . 33 percent from 6 . 33 percent . based on bloomberg composite ratings , most of enron ' s long - term debt is rated at bbb 2 and bbbl , two or three levels above investment grade . fastow continues to work , and enron hasn ' t punished him , palmer said . fastow declined to be interviewed , spokeswoman karen denne said . sec spokesman john heine declined to comment on the agency ' s request to enron . ` ` we believe everything that needed to be considered and done in connection with these transactions was considered and done , ' ' lay said in the statement . uniprime signs letter of intent for wind energy park project 10 / 22 / 2001 business wire ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , business wire ) apache junction , ariz . - - ( business wire ) - - oct . 22 , 2001 - - uniprime capital corporation inc .

"" there were 10 more votes that were "" close "" and stood a "" reasonable chance "" of being cast in favor of the bailout . however , that still left hertzberg 9 votes short of the 41 he needs . earlier today , sen . polanco , the bill ' s sponsor , privately indicated that the few remaining votes necessary to pass the amended sb 78 xx were in place due to lobbying efforts by gov . davis . no doubt the count will be close , but hertzberg will only take the bill up in the assembly for a vote today or tomorrow if he knows democrats can muster enough support . the key issues related to getting the 41 votes to pass sb 78 xx are the following : including the option to buy the transmission lines . for some this is a philosophical issue ; these members are quite adamant that the option to buy the lines needs to be removed from sb 78 xx . excess profits and creditworthiness - in particular how edison can use any profits . the philosophy underlying the bill itself as to whether a bailout is necessary given the experience with pg if the language comes out of the bill , the plan will no longer be acceptable to socal . socal : selling out or going under there is word in sacramento of companies "" sniffing around "" for a pre - packaged purchase of edison after the bankruptcy occurs . we will continue to investigate possible buyers and report when information becomes available . it is also rumored that if an "" inadequate "" bill passes - i . e . , one that will not return socal to creditworthiness - socal may declare voluntary bankruptcy , then use whatever bailout is passed as a revenue stream in bankruptcy . the only requirement laid upon socal is to attempt to go back into the market by january 2003 , and there is no penalty for them failing to do so . there appears to be nothing in the bailout bill that would preclude them from using money from the bailout in bankruptcy ."	0

"Subject: california update 6 / 1 / 01 below are details of new plan currently being created by california state treasurer phil angelides and supported by sen . burton . the plan is in the initial stages and is not currently on any legislative fast - track . it is also not motivated by a desire to save socal from bankruptcy . the creator ' s goal is to give californians more control over their energy and electric futures as well as giving the tax / rate payers a share of the pie in return for money that has / will go to the utilities . we will continue to monitor this plan , its supporters and progress . plan z california state treasurer phil angelides and a powerful group of legislators are finally taking action and are developing a plan to solve california ' s energy crisis this summer . the group is comprised of leftish legislators , environmental advocates , in - state energy company executives and business leaders and they are pulling together a plan z . at the core of the plan is the recently passed authorization to erect a california public power authority that issues bonds , constructs new power plants and buys up transmission lines . there is even talk within this group of using newly legislated authority to buy socal edison for $ 3 . 5 billion ( less than it owes ) although they would face huge obstacles and receive strong opposition from power companies as well as edison itself . the five - year goal is to have enough power generation capacity to guarantee a 5 % - 15 % "" cushion "" against energy peak demand . angelides and burton want to create enough capacity to form a buyer ' s market . one of the points of the plan is to replace private sector generation with more public sector generation . this plan may short - circuit private sector plans to build new plants , but the state has the ability to issue $ 5 b in revenue - backed bonds ( in addition to the $ 12 b rate - backed bonds ) . the second key element in the angelides - burton plan z is additional rate hikes for california ' s consumers and businesses . although discussions are still underway between this group and business leaders , angelides is wanting to propose an additional 45 % increase in residential and commercial electricity rates , however , there is immense sympathy for loading a disproportionate share of the burden on businesses . this increase is on top of the 50 % - 60 % already mandated by previous puc decisions this year . these rate increases will do two things : stop the immediate fiscal drain on the state of california and prevent emergency tax hikes ( being serious considered last week ) . issues to consider in regards to this plan are : ( 1 ) how much will current shareholders be diluted in return for helping the utilities repay long - owed debts ( or what would they get if the state decided to buy up all of socal edison ) ; and ( 2 ) how much will creditors have to "" eat "" in the legislated repayment plan ? in other words how big will the equity and bond haircuts be ? there is no answer to these questions right now as legislators work to cobble together a plan with numbers that work without triggering a massive and politically destructive rebellion by voters next year ."	0

' s finances is likely drawing closer to answering questions about complex partnerships that wiped out more than $ 1 billion in shareholder value and almost $ 600 million in profits . sec officials don ' t discuss their works in progress , but already the results are becoming clear . the company admitted that massive accounting errors over the past four years led it to overstate its profits and understate its debts , an admission that no doubt saved the company from some sec penalties , say observers . and the company has gradually distanced itself from its former chief financial officer - considered the architect behind some of the deals - and indicated that other employees were personally involved in the partnerships without its knowledge . but the culpability of enron ' s current or former employees , if any , won ' t be clear for some time . on oct . 17 , the day after enron reported an unexpected third - quarter loss , the sec began asking enron questions about two off - balance - sheet partnerships , called ljml and ljm 2 . they were formed to help the company grow without adding additional debt or diluting stock valuations , and were also used to help hedge against the risks in some of enron ' s newer lines of business . former cfo andy fastow formed the partnerships with the approval of the company ' s board of directors , attorneys and auditors . his dual role as cfo and managing partner of those two partnerships had the appearance of a conflict of interest , even though enron insisted that measures were taken to prevent any illegal or unethical behavior . the sec ' s role in looking at the partnerships isn ' t to prevent company executives from having conflicts of interest in their dealings , however , but rather to make sure the companies fully disclose those conflicts or any situations that may appear to be conflicts , said john coates , a professor at harvard law school . "" so although they have a role in determining that all the information in enron ' s proxy was correct and that all transactions were reported , they were not responsible for determining whether or not the transactions were done on fair terms , "" coates said . item 404 of sec regulation s - k requires companies to disclose any transactions where executive officers personally benefit by $ 60 , 000 or more . that disclosure should include their direct and indirect interests in the deal , the amount of money or assets they receive through it and other information . as in all rules , however , there are certain exceptions . if an executive ' s compensation from a deal is less than 10 percent of the value of the overall transaction , they may not need to disclose all of those details , coates said . that stipulation could possible give enron cover for not having previously disclosed the $ 30 million fastow earned through the partnerships . "" but there are times when the companies may have followed the letter of the rules and the sec still pushes them to fully disclose the details , "" he said . whether or not enron needed to disclose previously the investments or profits that a number of other employees made in some of the partnerships is also hard to discern . the company said this week that in addition to fastow , five other employees invested in the deals . two of those employees - ben glisan , a managing director and treasurer of enron corp . , and kristina mordaunt , a managing director and general counsel of an enron division - were terminated by enron this week . the other employees , including fastow and executives michael kopper , kathy lynn and anne yeager , no longer work for enron . the company didn ' t mention how much those individuals invested or how much benefit , if any , they reaped from the deals . some of the employees may not even fall under the disclosure rule since it doesn ' t give a clear definition of what positions are "" executive officers . "" the company has gradually distanced itself from fastow and the partnerships since the problems arose . shortly after the earnings report last month lay said he and the board stood by fastow , but a day later replaced him . on oct . 31 , the day enron said the sec had upgraded its review of the finances from a simple inquiry to a formal investigation , the company announced that its board of directors had created a special investigation committee of its own . a company spokeswoman stressed that the committee had the power to take disciplinary action against any enron employee , officer or director who it determines "" improperly participated in the transactions . "" in its sec filing that outlined the partnerships on thursday , the company said it was aware of the partnerships but required that certain safeguards be put in place and that the transactions be approved and reviewed regularly . "" whether these controls and procedures were properly implemented is a subject of the special committee ' s investigation , "" the statement said . at a friday news conference , lay said the board was aware of the formation of one of the partnerships but that he was not aware that glisan and mordaunt were investing in the partnerships . lay deflected many of the questions regarding the investigation , saying a conference call would be held next week . shareholders have lined up behind lawsuits against the company , the partnerships , and even the company ' s law firm , vinson & elkins . "" disclosure cases and state corporate law cases are all but assured in situations like this , "" coates said . "" even if the sec does very little , the shareholders will still line up .

"" the fact we have had multiple blows has certainly had a negative effect in the short run , "" said barton smith , director of the institute for regional forecasting at the university of houston . but in the long run , smith said , a city ' s future has more to do with its quality of life and the quality of its infrastructure than whether the city has lost or attracted a major headquarters . "" when boeing left seattle , we said , ` poor seattle , ' "" smith said . "" ( three months later ) seattle is still growing and still known as a good place to live . "" what is more important in terms of houston ' s corporate image and its image in general , smith said , is "" whether it ' s easy to get around and get to work and how smoothly a businessman can get to tokyo or london . "" smith believes houstonians should be more concerned about other local problems such as getting the city ' s pollution problem "" under control in a rational way . "" if houston continues to be known as one of the most polluted cities in america , smith said , "" that will continue to haunt us . "" the demise of enron is "" certainly not good news , nor was compaq good news , "" said steve klineberg , a rice university professor of sociology . the two companies enhanced the city ' s image and stature , klineberg said , in that they signified that houston was moving out of a 20 th - century oil - based economy into a 21 st - century economy based on information and technology . in terms of image , the enron news is more damaging within the business community than to the perception of houston by the world at large , said steve currall , associate professor of management psychology and statistics at the jesse h . jones graduate school of management at rice university . "" enron has very little business - to - consumer activity , and for the average person on the street "" it doesn ' t mean much , he said . but it is significant to the business community , currall said . enron has been a fortune 10 company and consistently ranked as one of the most innovative companies in america . "" and i think the struggles of enron ( have ) a negative impact "" in the business community , he said . "" houston has benefited from a company like enron , which has made the city a world headquarters for energy trading , "" currall said . "" it made us a hub for the development of financial management innovations . "" it ' s part of the reason why enron and dynegy resonate with the wall street gang . they say , ` that trading stuff down there is cool . ' it ' s the convergence of highly sophisticated finance and the energy industry . "" currall said he is delighted that dynegy is enron ' s "" suitor "" because it keeps the people and operations in houston . "" that ' s great news for houston , "" he said . others agreed that the presence of dynegy in houston will soften the blow . enron being bought by dynegy , another houston firm , is "" like a couple of cousins getting together , "" said barry silverman , a marketing and management consultant . "" in a sense , there is no loss for houston , "" said david crossley , president of the gulf coast institute , a nonprofit group that promotes quality - of - life issues in the area . "" who would have thought that a company in houston was capable of buying enron ? "" crossley said . it makes dynegy a bigger company and , he said , creates a certain mystique about houston since both cutting - edge businesses are here . david morris , the managing partner of the houston office of heidrick & struggles , an executive recruiting firm , believes that houston has been unfairly stereotyped as having a "" gunslinger "" style of business environment , and he is concerned that "" what ' s perceived as a gunslinging type of accounting at enron will be underscored once again . "" but what should really be emphasized , morris said , is houston ' s creativity . "" that enron took an old - line industry of gas transmission and re - created it into the marketing of gas and trading of gas and hedging of the price for gas - creating different value streams in the same industry - and did it before the rest of the world could grasp it all is pretty amazing , and none of that is going away , "" he said . that point was echoed by don henderson , vice president and managing director of hyatt regency , houston , and the recent chairman of the greater houston convention and visitors bureau . "" when you think of new york , you think of the stock market , "" he said , "" and when you think of chicago , you think of agribusiness . "" and more and more when you think of houston , it ' s energy as a commodity . and it ' s only going to be stronger with all the mergers and acquisitions because the business of trading energy as a commodity is only going to grow . "" henderson maintained that houston is still the envy of much of the country . houston has always been one of the continuously booming economies , he said , and "" has bounced back quicker and stronger than any region . "" to offer an example of the city ' s resilience and appeal , henderson noted that hewlett - packard chief executive officer carly fiorina recently stated that the work force of compaq ' s houston campus might increase in size in part because of the city ' s business - friendly environment compared to what she described as a less friendly business climate in california . silverman maintained that the recent experiences of various local businesses "" won ' t hurt our image at all . "" "" in this global economy , you often see companies changing names and headquarters , "" he said . "" it ' s like a monopoly game .

"" the appropriateness of that time diminishes the further it gets from the present . neither enron officials nor investors need to wait for the committee ' s report to conclude that letting executives profit on the side from the partnerships while sticking stockholders with the liabilities was inappropriate . for the sake of enron , its stockholders and the citizens of houston , who depend on enron ' s contribution to the economy and the civic life of the city , that arrangement must not be repeated . much of enron ' s problems stem from straightforward but imprudent or ill - timed investments : a power plant in india , broadband capacity not needed in a collapsing telecommunications market , and a doomed venture into the water business - azurix corp . those losses might have been survivable , had enron not denied its own transactions the transparency it sought for global energy markets . copyright ? 2000 dow jones financial desk deregulation not derailed by california ' s meltdown power : though many energy firms were scarred in the state ' s free - market stumble , analysts say they are likely to rebound . nancy rivera brooks times staff writer 11 / 11 / 2001 los angeles times home edition c - 1 copyright 2001 / the times mirror company branded as lawless cowboys by california politicians and consumer advocates , energy merchants rode skyrocketing electricity and natural gas prices to new stock highs during the worst of california ' s energy crisis . but in recent months these energy companies - - names such as duke , dynegy , reliant , aes , mirant , williams and el paso corp . - - have seen their fortunes dim as california ' s electricity meltdown has slowed the pace of deregulation nationwide , power prices have tumbled and the economy has faltered . even power plant owners and energy trading operations that have maintained healthy earnings growth have watched their stock performance fade . and then there ' s the enron effect . enron corp . , cast as the heavy by california politicians , has suffered the biggest fall of all and has helped to drag down stocks of other energy producers and traders . enron ' s woes appear to be a special case in that they flow less from its energy businesses than from a loss of investor confidence in the company ' s complex and shadowy financial structure , with a resulting cash crunch . nonetheless , enron ' s detractors are crowing at the rapid decline of the truest believer in electricity deregulation , the movement to take businesses controlled for decades by monopoly utilities and throw open the generation , trading and retail sale of electricity to new competitors . but just as enron is not dead , neither is electricity deregulation , energy experts contend . though several states have delayed their deregulation plans and some major corporate players are tempering their enthusiasm , other states and corporations press ahead . it ' s a tough new world for energy companies that will bring profit opportunities for some and acquisitions of low - priced players , analysts say . enron , once the most brash of the energy peddlers , has agreed to be acquired by archrival dynegy inc . in a $ 7 . 7 - billion stock deal . yet when the economy and power prices improve , energy companies will see their prospects gleam again , analysts say . "" deregulation is a train that ' s not going to be derailed . it may be delayed , but it ' s coming , "" said jon kyle cartwright , senior energy analyst with brokerage firm raymond james & associates . "" when the economy rebounds , we ' re going to see higher energy prices again , "" cartwright said .

"" these are the energy merchants that seem to have the best grasp on the market and on risk management , "" said chris ellinghaus , power and natural gas analyst with williams capital in new york . many of these companies are diversified geographically and by the fuel they use to generate electricity and had locked in favorable contracts that protected them when power prices fell this summer , he said . abn amro utility analyst paul patterson said investors have turned away from these companies , even the healthy ones , because the business "" isn ' t as exciting as it used to be .

"" the company even managed to persuade investors its convoluted management structure , which some believe is the root cause of its demise , was a positive thing . "" you can ' t kiss the ass of 24 people , "" said former enron chairman jeffrey skilling . "" and together those 24 people are more likely to have the interests of the shareholders at heart than any one person . "" unfortunately , behind the scenes , all hell was breaking loose . the last couple of months have given the market a long , embarrassing string of revelations about the company it once cherished . the company has $ 13 bn of outstanding debt , and has found its access to funds extremely limited . two weeks ago , as a measure of its desperation , enron had to secure a rescue loan against its 25 , 000 - mile network of gas pipelines . along the way , details of the group ' s botched expansion into india have made for supremely depressing reflections on management . crowning the whole sorry tale , and driving the shares down 80 per cent , was the opening last month of a securities and exchange commission probe into the accounting for some of enron ' s partnerships . last week came the sacking of the group ' s treasurer and corporate lawyer , and a revision of earnings for the last four years to the tune of half - a - billion dollars . despite it all , dynergy ' s bid could be the steal of the century . until all its troubles are out in the open , enron may be just a little too grimy for many potential buyers . but even the most bearish analysts can see there are rich pickings from the old enron empire . dynergy ' s big problem is snapping them up before the big boys , including chevron or shell , poach the good stuff . leo lewis copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . usa : wall street takes aim at accounting tricks . by deepa babington 11 / 11 / 2001 reuters english news service ( c ) reuters limited 2001 . new york , nov 11 ( reuters ) - wall street is starting to refuse to bite the bait on dubious earnings numbers highlighted by corporations in press releases . companies tout profit figures , frequently called pro forma results , that strip out unseemly one - time charges and expenses at record levels - more than $ 200 billion this year alone . investors , analysts , and accountants are revolting , and pressure is building to do away with the medley of different profit numbers or at least cut down on it . standard & poor ' s , a major compiler of earnings and other financial data , now will treat restructuring charges , stock option expenses , and write - downs from ongoing operations as part of a company ' s operating earnings - items that many companies exclude from their version of operating earnings . "" in the past , s & p would take a company ' s special charges at their word , "" said s & p analyst robert friedman , who was involved in the project . "" but now we ' re going to say , ' hey , wait a minute . ' "" the decision underscores the momentum building on wall street to scrutinize corporate accounting . one recent high - profile victim of this movement was enron corp . the energy trading company faced a crisis in investor confidence after it became clear it had boosted profits and racked up debt through complex financial transactions known as off - balance sheet deals . the deals , which were structured so they wouldn ' t show up on enron ' s balance sheet , caused enron to chop almost $ 600 million off earnings for the last four years . the once - mighty company lost $ 20 billion in market value , and on friday agreed to be bought by smaller rival dynegy inc . investors are scared of such stock market casualties . that ' s partly why they want to crack down on pro - forma numbers , which often present a much rosier picture of a company ' s performance because they exclude a whole bevy of costs that drag down the bottom line . "" hopefully , this will put pressure on companies to think twice when they put out their financials , "" said friedman . tech companies , in particular , conveniently have stripped out everything from inventory write - downs to severance costs from their bottom - line figures and pressured analysts to do the same with their earnings estimates . mobile phone maker motorola inc . , for example , reported a third - quarter pro forma loss of $ 153 million early last month . after including charges for investment impairments , cost reduction activities and additional reserves for its financing of a turkish cellular operator , however , the company posted a whopping $ 1 . 4 billion loss . a motorola spokesman was not available for comment . the practice has also made it difficult for analysts and investors to compare the results of one company against its peers as each comes up with its own ideas of what should be included in pro forma earnings . "" there are so many variants of pro forma that it can cloud comparisons , "" said david zion , an accounting analyst at bear stearns . the proliferation of these reports has also caught the attention of the nation ' s accounting rule makers , even though they don ' t have the authority to police press releases . the financial accounting standards board ( fasb ) two weeks ago said it is pressing ahead with a project that will look at how some closely watched items such as pension fund income should be classified and presented in financial statements . corporate america was not enthused by the idea and several corporations wrote to the accounting body urging it not to go ahead with the plan , said the project ' s senior manager , ronald bossio . but fund managers and investors are applauding . in a survey of 223 portfolio managers by capital markets firm broadgate consultants , nine out of 10 stock pickers said companies need to improve how they report results . fasb needs to come up with one key indicator of financial performance , and companies should abide by it , they basically said . if the accounting rule - making body accepted ebitda , or earnings before interest , taxes , depreciation and amortization , as a key measure , companies ought to calculate it in a consistent manner and display it as a separate item on their statements , almost all managers agreed . "" i think that pro forma thing is just a way to get around generally accepted accounting principles , "" said debra mcneill , a portfolio manager at fremont investment advisors . "" i think there needs to be some guidelines to be set out on pro forma numbers , but it does not necessarily need to be banned . copyright ? 2000 dow jones instead , they extend a slew of tax breaks , routinely approved by congress , which are about to expire . at the white house , spokesman ari fleischer said the senate bill contained "" too much spending and not enough stimulus . "" he lambasted the $ 220 million in the bill for bison meat , eggplant , cauliflower and pumpkin growers - in essence , a government subsidy for commodities that have "" experienced low prices during the 2000 or 2001 crop years . "" thirty - four commodities would qualify . but senate finance committee chairman max baucus , d - mont . , said aid for the ailing agricultural sector is an appropriate element of a recovery plan . "" when our national economy declines , rural areas are often among the areas that are hit the hardest and that recover slowest , "" baucus said . another industry that could benefit from the senate bill is the motion picture industry . like the house bill , the senate bill allows businesses more quickly to write off their investments in assets whose value depreciates over a number of years . but unlike the house legislation , the senate bill includes a provision specifying that films are a depreciable asset qualifying for the tax break . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved ."	0

Subject: california update - - 09 . 10 . 01 the senate rules committee just met . during the hearing , senate leader john burton stated that : the senate intends to rewrite the version of the mou that the assembly approved last thursday night and sent over to the senate for final approval ( sb 78 ) . the version of the mou that will emerge from the senate sometime this week will look much more like the bill that originally passed out of the senate prior to the july summer recess . that bill was unacceptable to edison and davis , which led to the version that the assembly developed and approved last thursday night . if the senate proceeds as burton suggests , the chances are very low that an mou will make it through the legislature and get davis ' signature . burton generally sticks to his word . but there is still time for additional negotiations and sb 78 could squeak by . however , burton ' s comments in the rules committee certainly don ' t help 78 ' s chances for survival . finally , the assembly is currently debating the last surviving windfall profits bill , and the bill is having a hard time getting the votes necessary for passage . more information on the windfall profits bill as we get it . best , jeff	0

notably , on the wholesale side , the continental , uk and nordic power and gas teams keep going from strength to strength as we see exceptional growth in volumes and transactions continue this quarter . total physical and financial settled volumes for gas and power in europe have seen an increase of 172 % in the first six months of the year compared to the first six months in 2000 and the total number of transactions per day has risen to 604 from 272 last year . specifically , uk power volumes are up 204 % to 147 twh in the first six months of 2001 from 48 twh in the same period last year . continental gas volumes have grown from 351 bbtue / day in 2000 to 1 , 390 bbtue / day in 2001 - a 296 % increase - and continental power volumes have seen growth of 360 % with volumes rising from 18 twh in the first six months of 2000 to 83 twh for the same period this year . the growth in volumes is not simply limited to the uk and continental markets , however , as nordic power volumes have increased by 153 % from 29 twh to 73 twh in the first half of 2001 . the success stories are not just limited to gas and power trading , however , and abound throughout the business : enron energy services the retail business has experienced a real boost this quarter with the closing of ees ' first , major "" marquis "" brand energy outsourcing transaction with supermarket giant , j . sainsbury plc . of equal importance , enron direct ' s business continues to grow with total customers now in excess of 160 , 000 . the success of enron direct ' s business model has translated into the development of new business on the continent in the netherlands and spain and , more recently in north america , with the 2 nd quarter opening of enron direct canada . enron credit a year after enron credit ' s launch , the total life to date notional value of transactions has surpassed $ 11 . 8 billion and in the 2 nd quarter alone , enron credit generated $ 10 . 4 million in ebit . further , more than 20 , 000 readers per week view the enron cost of credit ( ecc ) through independent publications . enron australia with 2 nd quarter power volumes up 177 % from the first three months this year , enron australia is gearing up for a strong growth year . with the development of a physical power position key to expanding enron ' s power trading in australia , work began this quarter to identify and begin the initial pursuit of asset development projects . other businesses undergoing significant expansion this quarter were coal , renewable energy credits and weather derivatives . spain : arcos the arcos asset development project in spain continues to make great progress with third party access to gas supplies for the power project being successfully negotiated this quarter , plus the project achieved another milestone in the permit / government approvals arena with the granting of its water concession in q 2 . uk : etol etol , a long - standing contributor to enron europe ' s earnings , generated yet another profitable transaction this quarter with the signing of a series of deals with chemical giant du pont for supplies at wilton international . the transaction further strengthens enron ' s relationship with du pont , one of etol ' s largest customers , and will extend the current steam and power supply contract through 2010 . enron metals a year after entering the metals business , enron metals has seen increased volumes of 130 % in its merchant and financial trading operations this quarter with volumes up to over 3 . 5 million tonnes as compared to just over 1 . 5 million tonnes in the 2 nd quarter last year . not only has the team seen positive growth in volumes this quarter , but they have increased their share of trading on the lme by 50 % and are making significant progress with project salem - a major it and systems improvement project that will streamline deal capture and risk management for metals transactions . finally , the metals team achieved a true home run this quarter when they closed a major ten - year origination transaction that , through the addition of smelting assets , will enable the metals team to improve its trading position . the transaction proved to be the perfect opportunity to leverage all of enron ' s trading and origination capabilities and involved input from a number of groups across enron . looking to the future , we have every expectation that the strong growth we ' ve witnessed in europe for the first half of the year will continue through end 2001 . so , in the words of solomon smith barney analyst , ray niles , when talking about enron ' s european wholesale operations results this quarter , "" europe is kicking butt and it ' s about a quarter of [ enron ' s ] activity , nearly double what it was last year . and , that is a new market that is the size of the us .

users , rights , books , global data - is completed and tested on a per application basis . some code changes may still be in process but integration testing can begin to ensure the applications still talk to each other . 3 ) integration test planning focus will be to run representative transactions from eol to sap through all core trading applications to ensure that applications and interfaces still work . we will not be testing functional permutations , data conditions , validation or exceptions to any significant degree . 4 ) each application conversion team must test their changes before approving their changes for integration testing . we are operating from the premise that data , infrastructure and code changes have been tested at a application system level before the enterprise integration test starts . 4 ) all systems will be physically split ( even unify at this point ) . 5 ) integration test team will develop and execute the test plan for both estate and new co . 6 ) we will integrate key business reps into the process for planning and execution and they will have shared responsibility for signoff on the test to support go live to production . 7 ) we will minimize the differentiation between new co and estate for conversion and test team purposes . there are two teams - conversion and integration test . each team will focus on both estate and new co . resources are too tight and the process is too inefficient to separate responsibility . 8 ) estate conversions must happen at the application level before new co conversion work can begin in earnest . estate conversion is on the critical path for new co . key issues 1 ) we will push to get a decision to see if we can focus on financial trading first , then physical . if financial is the focus , delivery risk goes down dramatically . for now , we must plan on the worst case - - physical and financial on jan 20 . 2 ) we need both a dev and a test environment for all systems that support aep and bridgeline in estate . this means that we need a dev environment ( and hw gap addressed ) for unify , sitara , cpr , tagg / erms . conversion teams need to coordinate with infrastructure immediately on this issue to make sure we ' re in synch . 3 ) unify servers probably can ' t be owned by new co while running a single license of unify . 4 ) some systems are using ' short name ' instead of duns id as a key for counterparties from global . the global , tagg / erms , unify and sap reps must quickly define the best approach for making global data changes and minimizing hard coded reference id risks . 5 ) we must clearly define limits of conversion and test scope to hit these potential dates . we must focus on core systems with only core changes required to support day one trading . 6 ) we can only convert estate over the weekend due to aep / bridgeline considerations . the time window will be very small . core conversion team 1 ) steve stock -

Subject: 2002 ea budget with enw budget update / suggestions : piper , richter , and webb met with whalley this saturday for a few hours on overall enrononline strategy and budget . we showed him the development completed to date and the general development list going forward . we also showed him the down time report as well as some growth numbers over the last 12 months . we also explained a few of the commercial objectives going forward . finally , we showed him the same suggested eol budget plan we showed you , including 2001 plan vs . 2001 forecast vs . 2002 plan as well as the allocation methodology . greg is generally ok with the total 2002 plan number for eol ( $ 37 . 7 million fully loaded with bonus , indirects and depreciation ) , why we want that money and where it would be spent . what he did not like was the allocation methodology , which is currently cost based and based on development and products . he suggested a charge that included a fixed fee plus a product setup fee plus a product maintenance fee plus a per transaction charge , etc . richter and webb are researching that and will try to see if it will work . i think you and i can agree the $ 37 . 7 million is good for 2002 but we still need to agree on your part for ea . the current cost based suggestion for ea for eol for 2002 is about $ 22 million . a question is , will you and lavo accept any charges for 2002 for eol based on transactions ? sheriff also has the entire eol suggested budget and his part . we meet eim and egm today on their total enw charges . on operations , the current suggested 2002 ea charge is $ 44 . 7 million , which is also a fully loaded number and is slightly down from 2001 forecast ( sally and bob and i can explain that in detail this week ) . what i would like to do is agree between you and i that you will accept that as eas budget number for 2002 plan for operations . what we still need to work on is how we would possibly bill that in some fixed and variable form that includes transaction counts . on infrastructure , the current suggested ea plan number for 2002 $ 40 . 9 million . this is down from 2001 forecast . this does not include the $ 10 . 5 million of controllable expense you budget directly for ea . the issue left here is what is eas headcount , what is the headcount in it development and what is the server infrastructure charge related to it development that would effect the ea number . on the first issue , we have the ea headcount as represented by hr . the current ea infrastructure charge assumes that complete number . it is larger than the number you have . you have requested we deal with some of that additional headcount differently since ea can ' t bill out those on a fully loaded basis . we will work with wes and his team on that today and tomorrow to come up with a plan . on it development , the current suggested 2002 plan expense number for ea , fully loaded , is $ $ 44 . 5 million vs . a 2001 forecast of $ 34 . 4 million . also , the 2002 suggested capital number for ea is $ 50 . 1 million vs . a 2001 forecast capital number of $ 50 million . the question is , what did you get for your $ 84 . 4 million in 2001 and what would you get for $ 94 . 6 million in 2002 ? first , mark and sally and i met on sunday and we want the 2002 plan numbers to be down from 2001 forecast . what we need to do in the next three days is finalize what are the critical maintenance and new development projects for 2002 for ea . our team is bob hall , mark pickering ( mark will call on stock and perlman and rao and hotte as he sees necessary ) and greg piper with pickering having the final say for enw . can you tell me who you want from your side ( story ? belden ? ) to work with us three over the next few days until we agree ? we want to work on it around the clock until it is at least approximately right . your thoughts ? gp greg piper president & ceo enron net works llc _ _ _ _ _	0

"" i know ( traders ) are getting a ton of calls , but i don ' t think there is going to be a mass exodus from the trading floor , "" said joe baker , president of houston - based search consultants international , a recruitment company that serves the energy and power marketing industry . enron , known for turning out some of the industry ' s most aggressive traders , also has a reputation as a tough training ground for newcomers , handsomely rewarding those who "" make their numbers "" and quickly showing non - performers the door . traders at other energy firms said experienced traders can earn six - figures salaries before annual bonuses , paid sometime between the beginning of january and the middle of march . a company recruiting traders before the bonus is paid would have to pay a larger sign on bonus . "" the majority of the key traders are going to wait and see what kind of situation develops . . . everyone ' s got their eyes open , "" baker said . "" most people want to stick around to see what kind of bonus they are going to get . "" wait and see energy traders are clearly worried about the $ 9 billion takeover announced last week , an opportunity for dynegy to chop head count . "" there ' s a lot of overlap at both firms . i don ' t think there will be enough room for everyone , "" a trader at another texas - based energy firm said . enron is the nation ' s biggest buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity . dynegy is about a fifth as big as enron measured in terms of revenue . despite the job uncertainty hanging over their heads , traders said they could not name a single enron or dynegy trader actively scouting out a new employer . "" everyone seems to be waiting to see what happens . there are only a few trader jobs open in the country right now . those positions will likely be filled pretty quickly if this merger goes through , "" another trader said . "" some ( traders ) are going to be looking for work no matter whether they ' re laid off or leave on their own , "" the trader added . so far , it is mostly enron support staff who are polishing off their resumes . enron said wednesday in an analyst meeting the company expects to take a charge for severance in the fourth quarter . however , no job cut numbers were discussed . baker said the support staff feels their jobs are the ones most threatened by the proposed dynegy merger . dynegy is buying enron for its trading operation and has said it is confident the best will stick around . upon completion of the merger , the combined company , to be called dynegy inc . , is expected to have revenues exceeding $ 200 billion and $ 90 billion in assets . dynegy agreed to buy its larger cross - town rival after enron investors lost faith in the company whose stock plummeted following its disclosure of off - balance sheet deals with partnerships run by its former chief financial officer . the stock was off 8 cents , or 0 . 8 percent , at $ 9 . 92 a share at the close on new york stock exchange trade wednesday , well below its 52 - week high of $ 84 . 88 . meanwhile , dynegy stock fell $ 1 . 58 , or 0 . 7 percent , to $ 46 . 20 a share . - scott disavino , new york power desk , + 646 - 223 - 6072 , fax + 646 - 223 - 6079 , e - mail scott . disavino @ reuters . com and nigel hunt , los angeles bureau + 213 - 955 - 6752 . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . usa : arbs tread lightly on enron - dynegy deal . by dane hamilton 11 / 14 / 2001 reuters english news service ( c ) reuters limited 2001 . new york , nov 14 ( reuters ) - merger arbitragers say they ' re treading lightly in betting over prospects for the $ 9 billion stock - swap takeover of houston energy trader enron corp . by rival dynegy inc . . these market pros , who bet on the likelihood a merger will be completed , say big questions about enron ' s financial condition raise doubts about the deal and make them shy about risking heavy bets . wednesday ' s conference call between enron officials and investors did little to assuage that , they say . "" people are very nervous about enron , "" said one arb at a major new york brokerage . "" they aren ' t sure if enron is actually earning anything . "" arbs who think a deal will eventually be completed may "" short "" the acquirer and buy target stock , reasoning that the acquirer ' s stock will fall and the target will rise on completion . but in recent days , enron ' s stock has languished , while dynegy ' s stock has gained more than 40 percent , although it was close to the same level a month ago . some arbs said dynegy ' s stock may have risen because it could gain valuable pipeline assets whether or not a deal is completed . enron said it granted dynegy an option to buy its northern natural gas pipeline system for less than $ 975 million if the deal falls apart after the months - long due diligence review . "" now dynegy has up to a year to look at the company and at worst , dynegy comes away with a very good deal , "" said one arb . "" even if it ' s a disaster , they come away with a very valuable pipeline . "" once a wall street high - flyer boasting a $ 90 share price just 15 months ago , enron fell from grace after off - balance sheet transactions and financial reporting lapses prompted a regulatory investigation and senior official resignations . looming debt and a collapsing share price led enron to agree to a takeover by smaller houston rival dynegy last week then valued at $ 10 . 41 a share , a fraction of its former value . enron officials on wednesday said they were confident that the company was close to gaining a clear picture of its financial condition following restatement of earnings over several years . but it said the securities and exchange commission investigation "" could affect us on a go - forward basis . "" even with commitments for billions of dollars in cash that enron said it ' s obtained in recent days , some arbs worried that customers who buy and sell energy contracts through enron may be abandoning the company , particularly for longer - term contracts . while enron officials said customers and others are getting "" comfortable in the short - dated market "" energy market , arbs said longer - term customers may worry that further damaging disclosures may threaten its financial viability . "" it may be that no one wants long - term agreements anymore with enron , "" said one arb , who like others , asked not to be named . "" i don ' t think they were completely open about that issue .

( adds analyst comment and details of lay compensation paragraphs 5 to 7 ) by andrew kelly houston , nov 14 ( reuters ) - enron corp . chairman and chief executive ken lay on wednesday acknowledged misjudgments and errors that pushed the nation ' s biggest energy trader to the brink of collapse and forced it to accept a humbling buyout by smaller rival dynegy inc . in a stunning mea culpa to analysts and investors , lay admitted that enron had made bad investments , overburdened itself with debt and conducted deals that led to conflicts of interest now under u . s . regulatory investigation . "" we fully understand and regret that the combination of these events has resulted in the complete loss of investor confidence . we are fully committed to fixing the problems , "" he said . lay ' s act of atonement came after enron said he had decided to waive his right to a $ 60 million golden parachute as part of dynegy ' s planned buyout , following a tense exchange with employees about his severance package on tuesday . lay received a base salary of $ 1 . 3 million from enron for 2000 plus bonuses totaling $ 10 . 6 million . he has also made several million dollars this year by exercising options and selling enron stock at prices which mostly ranged from $ 40 to $ 60 , according to enron filings . ubs warburg analyst ron barone said lay ' s candor could not undo damage already done but was welcome nevertheless . "" the fact that he ' fessed up ' is a step toward reestablishing credibility in himself and in the company , "" barone said . enron agreed on friday to be taken over by dynegy for about $ 9 billion in stock , after investor unease over enron ' s off - balance sheet deals drove its stock price down to $ 7 last week from a high of $ 90 . 56 in august 2000 . "" in hindsight , we made some very bad investments in non - core businesses , "" lay said in a 90 - minute conference call . many of those investments , such as an ill - fated venture into the water services business and a power plant project in india that became mired in a payments dispute , performed below enron ' s worst expectations , lay said . "" the negative impact of these investments have been exacerbated through the extensive use of debt capital both on and off the balance sheet , "" lay said . deals between enron and partnerships run by its former chief financial officer , andrew fastow , produced "" various conflicts of interest , both real and perceived , "" he added . fastow was recently replaced and the deals with the partnerships are now under investigation by the u . s . securities and exchange commission . lay , who built enron into the dominant energy trading company in north america and europe after it was formed by the merger of two natural gas pipeline companies in 1986 , said the core wholesale energy businesses were fundamentally sound . in the short term , he said , enron will focus on preventing further deterioration of its credit ratings and maintaining sufficient liquidity to keep the energy businesses running . enron ' s president and chief operating officer , greg whalley , said the company expects its recent woes to have a "" temporary but negative impact "" on profitability . whalley told analysts and investors that fourth - quarter results would also be adversely affected by severance costs and other restructuring costs . he did not provide details but said enron will issue earnings guidance in two to three weeks . the reference to severance costs was the first allusion to job cuts that are widely viewed as inevitable . enron also said it is seeking an additional $ 500 million to $ 1 billion in private equity to help rebuild confidence in the company and keep its core trading operations afloat in the nine months before the acquisition by dynegy is expected to close . it has already received $ 1 . 5 billion in cash from oil company chevrontexaco corp . , which owns 26 . 5 percent of dynegy . enron has been under heavy fire from wall street since mid - october when it said shareholder equity had been cut by $ 1 . 2 billion because of deals with the fastow partnerships . dynegy has said that its agreement with enron would allow it to back out of the acquisition if the company ' s problems , which include a stack of lawsuits from angry investors , turn out to be far worse than has already been disclosed . however , dynegy chairman and chief executive chuck watson has said he is confident this will not happen . watson will head the combined company , which will retain the dynegy name , and dynegy will dominate the combined company ' s senior management and board of directors . lay has said he has not yet made up his mind whether to accept watson ' s offer of a seat on the board of the new company . the california public employees retirement system ( calpers ) , the largest u . s . pension fund , said there should be no place for lay or any other enron directors on the new dynegy board .

( dyn ) provided enron corp . ( ene ) tuesday with the $ 1 . 5 billion cash infusion envisioned in the companies ' merger agreement , a dynegy spokeswoman said . dynegy received preferred stock and other rights in an enron unit that owns the northern natural gas pipeline in return for its investment . the cash infusion , which was made with the assistance of dynegy ' s largest shareholder , chevrontexaco corp . ( cvx ) , is aimed at providing enron with additional cash liquidity to support its core energy marketing and trading operations . the rights provide dynegy with the option to acquire the pipeline unit should the two companies fail to complete their merger . the deal , which still needs shareholder and regulatory approval , is expected to close within the next six to nine months . dynegy is acquiring enron for 0 . 2685 of a dynegy share , or about $ 10 billion based on the recent price of dynegy shares . the acquisition of enron by its smaller rival follows a series of disclosures about enron ' s financial dealings with partnerships run by some of its corporate officers . the dealings are under investigation by the securities and exchange commission and at the center of more than a dozen of shareholder lawsuits . during the last month , enron watched as its share price sunk to a small fraction of its earlier levels as shareholder confidence in the trading company evaporated . as credit - rating agencies began to cut enron ' s debt ratings threatening the company ' s investment - grade status , the company scrambled to raise additional cash to shore up its balance sheet and protect confidence in its business . industry experts viewed dynegy ' s cash infusion as one way the companies sought to bolster confidence in the energy trader ' s liquidity , and protect its most valuable business . in a conference call earlier wednesday , enron said its core energy trading business has been temporarily hurt by the uncertainty created by recent events . according to dynegy spokeswoman jennifer rosser , the preferred stock dynegy has received for its investment in enron is convertible into the common stock of the enron pipeline unit . dynegy also has the right to convert the preferred stock into enron shares if it desires , the spokeswoman said . for example , if enron were to cancel its merger with dynegy in order to accept a higher bid from another suitor , dynegy might decide to convert its preferred shares into enron stock in order to reap the profits created by an increase in enron ' s stock price , rosser said . in either case , dynegy wouldn ' t be required to pay any additional consideration . dynegy was able to make the cash infusion after chevrontexaco , of san francisco , made an investment in dynegy . if the acquisition closes as anticipated , chevrontexaco , which owns about one - fourth of dynegy , plans to make an additional $ 1 billion investment in the combined company . chevrontexaco also has the right to purchase an additional $ 1 . 5 billion in dynegy stock in the first three years following the close of the acquisition . enron officials said they are monitoring the energy market ' s reaction to the cash infusion , and hopes it will restore the confidence of its counterparties . enron remains on a credit watch at the credit - rating agencies . moody ' s investors service and standard 201 - 938 - 5166 ; christina . cheddar @ dowjones . com copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . usa : enron queried by epa on oil pipeline spills . 11 / 14 / 2001 reuters english news service ( c ) reuters limited 2001 . washington , nov 14 ( reuters ) - the nation ' s biggest energy trader , enron corp . , already reeling from bad investments , too much debt and possible conflicts of interest , said on wednesday that the government is seeking information on spills from pipelines operated by enron and its subsidiaries . in a filing with the securities and exchange commission , the houston - based company said it received a request for information from the environmental protection agency regarding certain spills and discharges since 1998 on oil pipelines operated by enron and its subsidiaries . eott energy partners llp is the only subsidiary of enron that has extensive domestic oil pipeline operations , according to the filing . enron ' s response was originally supposed to be filed with the epa no later than nov . 7 , but it received an extension until jan . 31 .

"Subject: western update 5 / 7 / 01 executive summary ? the likely outcome of the 16 may elections is a victory by the bc liberal party ( currently holding polls at 70 % ) , a pro - business , right - of - center party led by gordon campbell . ? major changes in british columbia energy policy are likely under a liberal government . ? a low snow pack , a return to regulation by the bc utilities commission and public concern about outstanding debts owed by us power consumers could force bc hydro to stop out - of - province power sales once existing contracts expire ? bc hydro ' s additional generation at williston is likely undeliverable liberal party platform ? income tax cut that would make bc ' s income tax the lowest in canada ? independent audit of the province ' s books amid allegations of ndp mismanagement and incompetence ? review of all crown corporations ( including bc hydro ) to enhance efficiency and management quality ? campbell has also said that he wants to scrap the corporate capital tax , the machinery equipment tax and the corporate income tax . energy agenda according to sources , under the liberal party ' s rule , significant changes in the bc government ' s energy policy could include a move toward the privatization of some bc hydro assets , perhaps including its transmission assets , as well as increased government support for independent power producers and coal - fired production . at the same time , a rate review and attempts to establish a broad electricity strategy for the province could lead to a lack of clarity about the province ' s overall energy strategy over the next few years . campbell reportedly is a proponent of deregulation and of expanding coal - fired production . campbell calls thermal coal , "" an asset that we want to be able to move forward with and to encourage once again in bc . "" a high - ranking ndp source believes that campbell will take the province back along the path of natural resources extraction rather than promoting new technology . the source expects this to lead to strong protests from environmentalists . "" these are confrontational moves , and people will be on the streets . "" campbell ' s most likely choice for energy minister is richard neufeldt , though we caution that this decision depends on the make - up of the legislature after the election . neufeldt is responsible for the liberal party ' s energy , mining and northern development portfolio . sources speculate that if right - wing liberals are dissatisfied with the party ' s performance after the may election , neufeldt could again defect to the opposition . however , this gives campbell even greater incentive to name neufeldt energy minister , a high - profile position . should the liberals win the election , gordon campbell has indicated that he would return bc hydro to regulation by the bc utilities commission . the bc government has derived $ 5 . 5 billion in revenue from bc hydro since 1991 ( roughly 85 percent of its profit ) . critics say this has undermined the utility ' s ability to pay down approximately $ 7 . 5 billion in debt and invest in the future . this also has left hydro without a rate stabilization fund , something that sources feel may be needed this year . campbell reportedly intends to address these issues , and one can expect this to lead to calls for change . electricity export policy currently the bc utilities commission is demanding more information about bc hydro ' s out - of - province sales . the commission has warned that , given the low snow pack , the utility could be a net importer of power this year . supporting this view , the northwest power planning council , representing bc hydro ' s key trading partners in the us , has said that it would not be able to rely upon british columbia or alberta during peak consumption periods over the next few years , and that its customers face a 25 percent chance of not making it through the winter without power losses . the combination of a low snow pack , a return to regulation by the bc utilities commission and public concern about outstanding debts owed to bc hydro by us consumers may force bc hydro to stop out - of - province power sales once existing contracts expire . bc hydro privatization a key campaign energy issue for the liberal party is the privatization of bc hydro . campbell has urged greater electricity competition , saying , "" we need to ensure the transmission infrastructure is available to all , producers and consumers , on an equal and non - discriminatory basis . "" he stated that independent power producers have been discouraged at every turn . "" i want to change that big time , "" he told the canadian institute of energy . campbell also urged more natural gas development , including pipelines and co - generation plants . campbell backtracked on this stance last week after being challenged by ndp leader ujjal dosanjh . campbell stated on 25 april , "" we have no intention of selling bc hydro ; we have no intentions of selling their transmission lines , no intention of selling their dams , we have no intention of selling their reservoirs . "" liberal party spokesman mike morton also reiterated on 29 april that bc hydro would not be for sale . a high - level ndp source commented that campbell has been extremely careful in his choice of words regarding bc hydro , essentially saying that he would not privatize the dams , transmission lines or generating stations , but that he is in favor of opening the sector up to competition . however , local sources believe that some parts of bc hydro might be sold as part of an overall review of bc crown corporations to enhance efficiency . likely sale prospects include bc hydro ' s distribution channels and its energy trading subsidiary , powerex . in addition , gary farrell - collins , the liberal finance spokesperson and possible second choice for energy minister ( after neufeldt ) , has stated that public ownership of bc hydro ' s non - core businesses , such as westech , its systems division , and customer billing , could come under review . bc hydro williston generation current reservoirs levels at bc hydro ' s williston hydro - generation facility are at 2 , 150 ft , which allows bc hydro to drop levels another 35 ft ( 170 gwhs / ft ) under their current permit . the one drawback to this plan ' s additional generation involves the mackenzie pulp mill that would have to cease operation if water levels were to fall below 2 , 140 ft . sources close to the minister of mines & energy - elect , richard neufeldt , indicate that levels at williston probably will not be drawn down below mackenzie ' s operational limits due to concern over political backlash ."	0

"Subject: western issues 7 / 23 / 01 below is the weekly western issues update sent to tim earlier . if you have any questions , please feel free to kristin walsh ( x 39510 ) . executive summary ferc multi - party refund negotiations bpa financials & smelter agreements bc hydro rate freeze power refunds the big event that happened last week in washington dc , in regards to california and the rest of the western energy markets , was that multi - party negotiations that flopped - apparently the difference between $ 8 . 9 billion and $ 703 . 6 million between parties could not be settled . below is a rough breakdown corporate offerings : williams , duke , reliant , dynegy , & mirant : $ 510 million combined powerex ( bc hydro ) : $ 125 million 15 power marketers including enron : $ 49 . 6 million 7 california municipal utilities : $ 6 . 5 million load - serving entities outside ca : $ 12 . 5 million northwest utilities submitted their calculations of overcharges , however , judge curtis wagner has virtually ignored northwest claims of $ 611 million in overcharges , stating "" there was little time to address the issues raised by the pacific northwest parties . they did not have data on what they are owed , nor an amount of refunds due them . "" contrary to the judge ' s claim , a number of northwest utilities did submit claim amounts at the settlement conference , although the problem is each utility has its own methodology for calculating these amounts . wagner was probably frustrated that there was no standard methodology for these calculations and appears to be leaning against giving nw utilities the same fast - track status as california . ferc had originally not even wanted to consider nw claims in this conference until a group of nw senators got together and applied some pressure - the result was there was not much time to get the overcharge data together . below is another rough breakdown of the claims : pacificcorp : $ 6 . 7 million snohomish pud : $ 229 million tacoma power : $ 71 . 9 million seattle city light : $ 222 million port of seattle : $ 11 . 1 million bpa : $ 70 million * bpa bpa borrowing : sen . patty murray ( d - wa ) has been leading the fight for bpa ' s request of $ 2 b in additional borrowing authority and was pleased the senate voted to increase access to additional funds , however , sen . murray has promised to fight the re - authorization caveat . murray ' s spokesman said the committee may have been concerned about ' bumping up against spending caps ' when it added the mandate for annual re - authorization . bonneville has warned it could exhaust its borrowing authority by the end of 2003 unless the amount was boosted from the current limit of $ 3 . 75 billion - - the increase got through the senate energy & water development subcommittee , but had the caveat added when it reached the full appropriations committee . increased borrowing authority would be used to update transmission infrastructure , retrofit columbia river hydropower projects to boost efficiency and continue conservation programs . we can expect to see more action coming out of sen . murray ' s office . refunds : recent media reports have hinted to the possibility of northwest utilities ( including bpa ) seeking refunds for the overpriced power california is currently fighting . this information seems supported by fears that earlier settlements reached between northwest utilities and california state may be challenged by bankruptcy proceedings . if a bankruptcy court were to issue a ruling that significantly altered agreements between bpa and pg & e ( & potentially bankrupt socal . ed . ) , it is possible that bpa could press a refund request in the range of $ 70 m to $ 100 m . however , while bpa ' s refund request may be an option to stabilize their finances , they are also careful about voicing their opinion because of the $ 167 million in gross sales they made from california bpa administration : the bush administration reportedly has no current plans to replace the bpa ' s administrator . the entire northwest delegation ( democrats and republicans from the bpa region ) has asked that he be made the full - time administrator . however , since many of the decision - makers at doe are conservative republicans , they ' re not comfortable with him because he is a democrat . at this time , doe people are unsure of how to handle this matter and appear to be in a state of limbo . dsi / aluminum smelter - load reduction agreements : bpa is in the hot seat right now , realizing that falling electricity prices is making it possible for smelters under load reduction agreements to begin shopping around for other sources . few believe that these current market prices will be sustainable , considering the fact that the west will see a significant supply increase within the next year . consequently , dsi ' s will be very concerned about signing long term price contracts given the current downward pressure on prices ( which are still historically very high , but dropping ) . currently , there are two northwest smelters seeking to restart plant operations . alcoa is in preliminary talks with bc hydro to secure additional power to restart its intalco smelter , and kaiser , free from the money and the constraints of a load - reduction agreement , is also attempting to restart plants . we will continuing monitoring of this situation and will update as the story develops . bc hydro rate freeze : the current rate freeze was imposed by the former ndp government , and it ends 30 september 2001 . it is up to the government to direct the bcuc to lift the rate freeze , and before it can do that , it has to schedule a rate hearing and decide to put the utility back under the bcuc ' s purview . it has been a number of years since there was a rate hearing , and people are not looking forward to it because it begs all sorts of questions about overall energy policy . a rate hearing will be delayed until the new government has completed its administrative "" core review "" and decided on a broader energy policy , including its goals for bc hydro . lifting the rate freeze partly depends on how much regulators believe should be held in the rate stabilization account - this money has been redirected elsewhere over the past few years , leaving the utility unprepared for the sort of low - water conditions that have surfaced this year . bc hydro wants the freeze lifted , and the new government will have an ideological bias against continuing the rate freeze given that it was put in place by the ndp and flouts free enterprise principles . this suggests the rate freeze is on the way out , but it may persist beyond the original 30 september deadline for the reasons outlined above . how long it persists depends on how long it takes the new government to complete the core review ."	0

( nyse : dyn ) beat expectations in the third quarter , reporting that its earnings rose to $ 286 million , or 85 cents per diluted share , from $ 177 million , or 55 cents per diluted share , for the same period in 2000 . this represented a 22 - percent increase from 3 q 2000 and boosted the company ' s 2001 earnings estimate . dynegy has a market capitalization of $ 14 . 5 billion . its stock is currently trading at about $ 43 down from a 52 - week high of $ 59 , although it is important to note that for year - end 2000 the company ' s stock was one of the top performers among standard dynegy , on the other hand , not only believes in the ownership of physical assets , but has set a goal that could ultimately establish the company as owning one of the largest generation arsenals in the industry . let ' s look at the companies separately . we ' ll discuss enron first since it is the older of the two . enron readily admits that its strategy is difficult to define , but a close approximation is that enron literally creates commodity markets so that it can deliver physical commodities to customers . the participation and success in commodity markets , according to enron , does not necessitate ownership of physical assets . in fact , the company has routinely sold physical assets that are not considered to be strategic to its wholesale business . rather , enron has concentrated on developing a new philosophy of risk management excellence , in which it will merely buy and sell the commodities it needs to participate in trading venues . as an example , enron bought portland general ( which owns 2 , 000 mw of generation and 41 , 600 kilometers of electric t & d lines ) in 1996 as a way to launch its penetration of the west coast power markets . when competition fizzled in that region , enron put portland general back on the sales block ( a sale of portland general to northwest natural is pending at this writing ) . likewise in europe , where it is one of the most prominent trading companies , enron has disposed of generation assets such as sutton bridge in england and , unlike other u . s . competitors , has refrained from buying additional generating units in opening countries such as germany and italy . according to its most recent 10 k report filed with the securities and exchange commission , enron owns or controls 2 , 015 mw of generating capacity ( including joint ownerships ) , which is drastically lower than the average among other companies operating in the power trading sector . dynegy ' s approach to the market is crystal clear and radically different from enron ' s . in the words of ceo chuck watson , "" dynegy ' s long - term strategy is to focus on marketing and trading around physical assets , which supports earnings sustainability . "" ever since going public in 1995 , dynegy has been on an acquisition binge , with each purchase significantly increasing its generation capability . dynegy presently owns or controls about 27 , 000 mw of generating capacity in the united states , 26 gas - processing plants and 14 , 000 miles of pipelines , which are located in geographically competitive areas . the company ' s goal is to own or control 70 , 000 mw , or 10 percent of the u . s . market , within the next five years . sometimes , dynegy has acquired assets through partnerships with other companies such as nrg energy , but just as often it has purchased assets independently . most notably , when dynegy acquired illinova in early 2000 , the purchase doubled dynegy ' s generating capacity . dynegy is now attempting to replicate this approach in europe , where it is presently planning to purchase natural - gas storage facilities in england . dynegy executives have argued that natural - gas storage is the best way to back up a natural - gas trading operation . there ' s no question that the approach is working . out of the $ 286 million that dynegy reported in the third quarter , $ 263 million of it came from the company ' s main wholesale business . the issue of asset ownership is probably the central defining difference between enron and dynegy , and its significance should not be overlooked . it is not difficult to make a case that supports dynegy ' s approach . owning physical assets often enables a trading company to gain information in the course of operating power plants that can help the company to gauge markets and anticipate small changes in price . in other words , by controlling the actual output of generation instead of just being involved in buys and sells , a trader such as dynegy will theoretically know what the load is going to be in a particular region , how much power can be produced to meet that load and when shortages might occur . in addition , in markets that are short on infrastructure , it may be difficult for a trader to participate in the market unless they actually have ownership of physical assets in the region . by the same token , those companies that do control physical assets often have greater communication with grid operators , and possible insight to spreads ( the difference between various energy prices ) . in fact , dynegy ' s ceo watson fully acknowledges that his company excels at being able to trade around the volatility of price , and being capable of resolving balances when shortages exist . this may be more difficult for a company such as enron to accomplish when it has no physical generation of its own to meet discrepancies in power bids . dynegy ' s strategy of acquiring both natural - gas pipelines and power plants also gives it the flexibility to trade on both commodities . on the other side of this argument , a case could be made that enron ' s approach provides more flexibility in reacting to trading volatility . certainly , by investing less in power generation facilities , enron has less capital on the line when compared to a company like dynegy . under a scenario when market prices suddenly drop , a company such as enron that does not have heavy capital invested in power generation could actually fare better than an asset - laden company because enron does not face the pressure to meet the fixed payments of a generation facility . asset - heavy companies also may find that their earnings could be impacted by the investment in generation facilities in times of extreme price volatility . as the industry becomes increasingly focused on bottom - line results , this could be seen as a potential concern for investors . further , some would argue that enron ' s approach of establishing purchasing contracts with various parties to meet its buy and sell requirements is the rough equivalent of owning a generation facility . what enron gains by this approach is the presumed flexibility it has by not being tied down to a specific generation unit and being able to build its own portfolio . consequently , the issue of asset ownership can perhaps be considered the "" great debate "" among power traders . however , although dynegy ' s overall performance in the third quarter was better than enron ' s , that does not necessarily provide a clear endorsement of dynegy ' s strategy toward acquiring new generation facilities . keep in mind that enron ' s 3 q losses resulted primarily from non - recurring charges related to its non - core businesses ( broadband and water in particular ) . without these charges , enron ' s core wholesale trading business continues to perform well . this is a point that ceo ken lay has been quick to reiterate to investors . "" our 26 - percent increase in recurring earnings per diluted share shows the very strong results of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural - gas pipelines , "" lay said . "" the continued excellent prospects in these businesses and enron ' s leading market position make us very confident in our strong earnings outlook . "" moreover , perhaps even more than ownership of physical assets , the key issue that played a role in the current disparity between dynegy and enron earnings in the third quarter is the companies ' approach to developing new lines of business . telecom is a perfect example to illustrate the point . enron , which prides itself as usually gaining a first - strike advantage , plunged into the telecom sector well ahead of other energy companies . under the leadership of then - ceo jeffrey skilling , enron sunk large sums of capital into purchasing broadband capacity on the expectation that the market would quickly become lucrative . now lay admits that the company "" could have gotten into the broadband business with less capital "" and that enron "" spent too much too soon "" in this sector . nevertheless , enron recorded an $ 80 - million non - recurring write - down for restructuring its broadband unit in the third quarter and is presently attempting to stop the bleeding in this sector by reducing future costs in this sector to $ 40 million a quarter . dynegy took a much more cautious approach toward expanding into the telecom sector and made a comparatively small amount of investment when compared to enron . dynegy has likewise been impacted by the slowdown of the telecom sector , but in the third quarter took a $ 15 - million loss in its broadband business compared to the $ 80 - million loss that enron reported . however , dynegy clearly specializes in marketing and trading two commodities ( electricity and natural gas ) and seems to add other businesses in a very methodical way that merely supplements its core business . it is also important to note that enron gained the first - strike advantage when it developed enrononline , an electronic trading exchange . in fact , enron was the first to create such an exchange in the energy space , well ahead of its competitors . dynegy later followed this trend with creating dynegydirect . the two exchanges are different in terms of their trading standards , but it is important to acknowledge that in this particular case enron was successful in launching into the electronic trading space well ahead of its competitors . the latest available information indicates that enrononline has recorded transactions that exceed $ 590 in notional value . since its inception in november 2000 , dynegydirect has recorded $ 33 billion in notional transactions . at this juncture , dynegy and enron are very different with regard to their approaches toward financial reporting . enron , which has often been accused of not providing a balance sheet to investors , is currently struggling from a serious image problem as the securities and exchange commission pursues an investigation of possible mishandling of funds by enron ' s cfo . to my recollection , no one has ever accused dynegy of not providing a balance sheet , and thus the company ' s status with investors is arguably more solid . as i don ' t expect either company to radically alter its competitive strategy any time soon , my projection is that ( at least in the near term ) , we will continue to see a wide disparity in wall street performance between dynegy and enron . that is not to say that anyone should count enron out of the game . as noted , the company ' s core business of wholesale business remains strong , but clearly has been tainted by the impact of other non - core businesses . that doesn ' t mean enron is down permanently , but it will have to find a way to strike a better balance between the businesses that it does best and those businesses that former ceo jeffrey skilling believed were advantageous . in many ways , the comparison between dynegy and enron is rather like the tortoise and the hare parable . i am sure you can guess which company is the tortoise and which is the hare in this analogy . the race between the two is far from over , although dynegy is taking the lead at this point , based on its more methodical approach . what will be fascinating to observe is how both companies continue to adapt to changes in the marketplace and possibly modify what up to this point have been adamantly espoused philosophies . _ _ _ _ _ correction statement to 10 / 23 issuealert on european trading : according to a news report from reuters , the u . s . -

Subject: off - site travel question the e - mail that was sent out many weeks ago about the off - site indicated that it would run from wednesday night to saturday am . it is now running thursday until sunday . calger has found a leased plane that costs roughly $ 13 k for one roundtrip and a total of $ 20 k for two round trips . i had already made arraingements to attend a wedding in oregon on saturday night . it is a good friend of mine and my wife ' s . it ' s in eastern oregon and is about a four hour drive away . i see the following choices before me : 1 . don ' t go to colorado . tell you guys that i ' m a family man and not a company man . 2 . go to colorado and fly home commercial on friday night , leaving at about 4 pm . incremental cost of flight would be $ 500 . 3 . go to colorado and fly home on the rented plane on early saturday afternoon . incremental cost of flight would be $ 7 , 000 . 4 . don ' t go to wedding . tell my wife that i ' m a company man and that it is critical that i ride mountain bikes with a bunch of 30 - something enron folks all weekend . while i have authority to place millions of dollars of the company ' s money at risk , i don ' t feel comfortable signing up for a $ 7 , 000 extra flight without talking to you guys . # 3 , the jet set answer costs quite a bit more , but it dramatically increases the amount of time that i spend in colorado . # 2 is cost - effective but gives me less than 24 hours in colorado . # 4 , while perhaps appealing to you , doesn ' t work for me . # 2 is probably preferable to # 1 , just requires a lot of travel time to me . any thoughts would be greatly appreciated .	0

"Subject: california update 5 / 22 / 01 please treat as confidential a source had a meeting today with california state treasurer phil angelides . here are the main points from their conversation 1 . anglelides certain that socal will go bankrupt corroborating our line over the past four months , anglelides stated with confidence that socal would go bankrupt and that "" he was surprised they hadn ' t already . "" he noted that the only reason they haven ' t yet is that "" they were too stupid to ring - fence the parent "" and that "" their two biggest equity holders were screaming not to do it . "" he added that the davis / socal mou is dead and that all the "" plan b ' s "" are "" speculative "" at best . he also thought that socal was being "" naive if they thought they would get a better deal from the legislature than from the bankruptcy court . "" 2 . bond issuance - $ 12 b not enough angelides conceded that a $ 12 b bond issue would not be enough to buy power for the summer and that the true costs would probably be $ 18 - 24 b . the only reason they didn ' t issue more is that angelides felt that "" $ 12 b was all the market could handle . "" the current game plan for bonds assumes an average peak price for power of $ 400 / mwh , which angelides said explains the difference between his estimates and the higher estimates from state comptroller ' s kathleen connell ' s office . 3 . new generator construction anglelides was explicit that the california public power authority ( authorized by the legislature last week ) will "" build plants and not stop until we [ california ] has a 10 - 15 % capacity cushion above expected demand . angelides expects the state to be "" 5 - 10 % short on power all summer .

( ene ) in the past two weeks , the stock is trading at about its book value , begging the question : so how much is it worth anyway ? the answer is far from easy . ever since enron metamorphosed from a stodgy gas pipeline company into what was seen by many as a dynamic energy trading firm , the company has become increasingly more difficult to understand . just a glance at the wide - range of wall street analysts who follow the company illustrates the point . in the mix are analysts who track natural gas and the pipeline industry as well as those who follow electric utilities . one enticing prospect is that the assets in its portfolio are valuable in and of themselves and could be seen by some as worthwhile acquisition targets . by enron ' s own definition , the company houses four main divisions : enron wholesale services , enron energy services , enron transportation services , and enron broadband services . wholesale services houses the company ' s energy marketing business and enrononline . this segment accounts for the bulk of enron ' s profits , and has become synonymous with what enron means to most people today . not only does enron trade gas , oil and coal , but it also trades commodities such as pulp and paper , petrochemicals , lumber , plastics and even weather risk . enron energy services is the company ' s retail arm . the company provides electricity , gas and commodity risk management services through this division . enron transportation services operates four natural gas pipelines that span about 25 , 000 miles and have a peak capacity of 9 . 8 billion cubic feet per day . through these pipelines the company says it transports about 15 % of the natural gas the u . s . needs . the segment also includes portland general , a oregon utility company enron is selling to northwest natural gas co . ( nwn ) for $ 1 . 9 billion in cash and stock . in addition , the company provides bandwidth and network services through its enron broadband services division . but enron ' s reach is even wider than this list suggests . the company also has a number of other corporate investments , including its stake in the azurix water business , enron renewable energy corp . as well as methanol and mtbe plants . through enron ' s unconsolidated affiliates , the company also has investments in additional water assets , a power plant in india and a natural gas pipeline in argentina among other things . what makes any valuation of enron difficult is what remains unknown about the company ' s financial structure . enron has yet to file a balance sheet for the third quarter , and doesn ' t expect to do so until nov . 15 , when balance sheets must be filed under securities and exchange commission regulations . without the balance sheet , some of the details needed for calculating a company ' s value are missing . also , much still remains unknown about the company ' s obligations to its off - balance sheet financing vehicles . using what is known about enron ' s finances , several analysts have arrived at their own conclusions about valuation . merrill lynch 201 - 938 - 5166 ; christina . cheddar @ dowjones . com copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . enron ' s stock jumps amid takeover speculation by juan . a . lozano associated press writer 10 / 31 / 2001 associated press newswires copyright 2001 . the associated press . all rights reserved . houston ( ap ) - after plummeting to a nine - year low following recent economic losses and an investigation by federal securities regulators , shares of enron corp . jumped nearly 25 percent wednesday amid speculation the company was ripe for takeover . shares of enron , the nation ' s largest natural gas and power marketer , rose $ 2 . 74 to close at $ 13 . 90 wednesday on the new york stock exchange . shares though are still down 69 percent since the company reported third quarter earnings just over two weeks ago . carol coale , an analyst with prudential securities inc . in houston , said wednesday ' s surge was likely a reaction to a the wall street journal report that enron ' s beaten - down stock price has stirred rumors of a possible takeover . others may be buying figuring the stock has hit bottom , she said . on tuesday , enron ' s stock closed at $ 11 . 16 , its lowest level since 1992 . enron shares began their steady fall in the middle of october , when the company reported a net loss of $ 638 million in the third quarter , taking a one - time charge of $ 1 . 01 billion attributed to investment losses , troubled assets and unit restructurings . some of these losses have been tied to partnerships managed by enron ' s former chief financial officer , andrew fastow , who was ousted last week . the potential conflict of interest has prompted an inquiry by the securities and exchange commission . earlier this week , moody ' s investors service downgraded the company ' s long - term debt and warned of possible further downgrades . potential buyers include general electric ' s ge capital unit , warren buffett ' s berkshire hathaway and royal dutch shell , the journal said . duane grubert , an analyst with sanford c . bernstein and co . in new york , said shell , which has a small presence in energy marketing , would be a good fit . "" shell tried to be in the merchant energy arena and didn ' t really succeed , "" he said . "" to buy into an established franchise must be attractive to shell . "" enron officials did not immediately return telephone calls from the associated press on wednesday . while enron ' s stock price has made it attractive , coale said the energy marketer ' s problems present a substantial drawback . "" i would fault a company for acquiring enron with all of this hanging over it , "" she said . "" there are too many uncertainties . "" grubert said he believes enron has the ability "" to weather the storm and restore their enterprise on their own . "" since reporting its disappointing third quarter losses , enron has been negotiating with banks to establish new credit lines . the company last week decided to cash in about $ 3 billion in revolving credit it has with various banks to shore up investor confidence . - - - on the net : http : / / www . enron . com copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . usa : few signs of domino effect among enron ' s peers . by andrew kelly 10 / 31 / 2001 reuters english news service ( c ) reuters limited 2001 . houston , oct 31 ( reuters ) - u . s . energy traders such as dynegy inc . and aquila inc . have taken a knock as a result of enron corp ' s recent woes , but analysts do not expect a broad loss of investor confidence in the sector to trigger massive losses in stock prices like enron has suffered . "" the issues impacting enron are pretty much specific to that company , "" said credit lyonnais securities analyst gordon howald . "" i don ' t believe that a lot of its peers have the same type of potential negative impact , "" he said . enron ' s widespread use of complex off - balance - sheet financing deals and its reluctance to disclose details about them are a key reason why investors have dumped the company ' s stock , causing it to fall more than 60 percent in the last two weeks . and while other natural gas and electricity marketers use similar techniques to avoid overloading their balance sheets with debt , nobody does so to the same extent as enron , analysts said . "" enron is a unique case in the magnitude of off - balance sheet transactions , "" said prudential securities analyst carole coale . uncomfortable with disclosure coale said she was not comfortable with the level of disclosure provided by many of enron ' s peers about such deals , but she said this was less of a problem at other companies because they have less exposure to the risky energy trading and marketing business which contributes about 80 percent of enron ' s profits . el paso corp . , for example is channeling over $ 1 billion in off - balance - sheet financing into its project electron venture which was set up to acquire and manage power plants . analysts say they are reasonably pleased with the information that el paso has provided to them about electron . el paso ' s stock has fallen a relatively modest 5 percent over the last two weeks and analysts attribute this in large part to the fact that marketing and trading operations generate only about one quarter of the company ' s earnings . dynegy ' s stock is down some 17 percent over the last two weeks and analysts said this was linked to dynegy ' s assumption of a leadership role among u . s . energy marketers in many investors ' eyes as enron began to fall out of favor and as dynegy attained a correspondingly high price - earnings ratio . asked about dynegy ' s use of off - balance - sheet financing , spokesman john sousa drew a contrast between his own company and enron , saying dynegy had no financing that was backed by issuance of stock , nor any "" related party transactions "" . former high - fliers shunned analysts said that in the current uncertain investment climate , investors are shunning trading - oriented companies ' whose stocks had previously commanded high price - earnings multiples and seeking out more modestly valued companies which own physical assets such as power plants and natural gas pipelines . in terms of recent stock price performance this trend has punished a marketer - trader like aquila , whose shares are down 27 percent over the last two weeks . on the other hand it has been relatively kind to companies such as williams cos . and duke energy corp . , which until recently were treated with scorn by enron executives who aggressively propounded an "" asset - light "" philosophy . williams ' stock has fallen about 5 percent over the last fortnight while duke ' s shares are down less than 1 percent and have outperformed the broader u . s . stock market . j . p . morgan analyst anatol feygin said enron had fallen victim to its unique taste for sophisticated financing techniques and its failure to explain them when doubts started to surface . "" enron took it to an extreme in terms of financial engineering , but it didn ' t disclose enough information about what is behind all of these structures , "" he said . credit lyonnais securities ' howald had a simpler explanation , saying that as the euphoria which surrounded enron last year subsided , people began to see enron for what it was . "" trading companies have always had a history of winning big and losing big , "" he said . "" i think the days of the big valuations are over , "" he added . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . waste management will start pulp and paper trading tomorrow 2001 - 10 - 31 16 : 52 ( new york ) waste management will start pulp and paper trading tomorrow houston , oct . 31 ( bloomberg ) - - waste management inc . , north america ' s largest trash hauler , will start trading paper and pulp tomorrow to limit the effects of price fluctuations of recycled materials and offer a service its biggest rivals don ' t provide . in the past three years , waste management has reduced its exposure to price swings by placing 75 percent of its recycled - commodity sales under long - term , fixed - price contracts . still , the company ' s revenue from recycling fell 38 percent to $ 154 million in the second quarter . chief executive officer maurice myers is hoping the trading business will help stabilize recycling revenue even when prices for cardboard , newspaper and aluminum cans fall . trading allows waste management to further limit its own exposure to prices , as well as offer contracts to customers who want to lock in prices . ` ` what waste management is doing is going to reduce the company ' s risk and their customer ' s risk , ' ' said thomas leritz , an analyst at banc of america capital management , which owns more than 1 million shares of waste management . ` ` i think it ' s a smart move . it ' s a reflection of the new management team .

"" at this level the stock is attracting money . however , the near term is not going to be good , "" said tim ghriskey , president of money managers ghriskey capital partners llc . "" we don ' t own any enron . we have in the past and sold a while ago . we ' ve been tempted a couple of times during the slide , but the information flow is not that strong , and there is potential for more negative surprises . "" enron closed up $ 2 . 74 , or 24 . 6 percent , to $ 13 . 90 on the nyse . the stock surged to an intraday high of $ 14 . 17 , recouping the past two days of losses , but is far from $ 33 . 84 , the closing price for enron on oct . 16 , the last day before the 10 - day tumble began . enron shares have been hammered over the past two weeks amid a series of unwelcome disclosures , including murky off - balance - sheet deals with partnerships once run by chief financial officer andrew fastow . the disclosures forced fastow ' s ouster , led to a securities and exchange commission inquiry into enron and caused at least one credit rating agency to cut enron ' s senior - debt credit status . the company said fastow ' s removal was aimed at assuaging investor concerns as the almost daily disclosures forced it to draw down about $ 3 billion from existing credit lines . trying to quantify ' worst - case scenario ' but that ' s not enough , say analysts and investors . "" enron needs to substantially improve the level of disclosures , "" said nitin khandkar , a portfolio manager with dubai - based al majid investment co . , which owns enron stock . "" the accounting policies it follows should not be merely legal but should also reflect the company ' s true profitability . "" as an industry heavyweight , "" investors expect enron to come clean on the controversial issues , "" he said . one issue enron would do well to address is its partnerships and the liabilities they may have . "" people are still struggling with trying to quantify what the worst - case scenario could be , "" said mike heim , an analyst with a . g . edwards & sons , of the existing partnerships . "" instead of dismissing the worst - case scenario , i think it would make sense to mathematically show that ' here ' s what happens under such a scenario ' and then let analysts make their own assessments . "" enron ' s refusal to make public its finances with greater transparency is a hallmark of arrogance , noted one academic . "" the lack of transparency is an arrogance that says , ' i don ' t have to explain anything because if people don ' t want to buy my shares , they can just sit and spin , ' "" said paul kedrosky , a professor at the university of british columbia who sits on the board of exponentia , a company dedicated to improving communications with shareholders . "" it ' s an arrogance that says , ' i do not have to disclose anything until i am forced to , ' "" kedrosky said . "" the crucial thing is to disclose early and disclose all . "" copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . waiting for balance sheets amid enron ' s debacle : david wilson 2001 - 10 - 31 16 : 39 ( new york ) ( commentary . david wilson is a columnist for bloomberg news . the opinions expressed are his own . ) princeton , new jersey , oct . 31 ( bloomberg ) - - international business machines corp . ' s press release about its third - quarter results included this statement , attributed to louis gerstner , chairman and chief executive officer : ` ` ibm ' s balance sheet remains among the strongest in the technology industry , or any industry . ' ' the largest maker of computers and provider of computer services wasn ' t the only company to cite its balance sheet , a statistical summary of what a company owned , what it owed , and what was left over for shareholders on a specific date . general electric co . , the largest company by stock market value , and citigroup inc . , the no . 1 financial - services company , made similar references in their third - quarter releases . none of the companies really showed people what they were telling them . ibm , general electric and citigroup are among 19 members of the dow jones industrial average whose most recent quarterly releases didn ' t include balance sheets . the evidence will come only when the companies submit their quarterly reports to the u . s . securities and exchange commission . balance sheets are required in the so - called 10 - q filings , along with the 10 - k filings that cover the full year . not much publicity by then , statistics about the companies ' assets , liabilities and shareholders ' equity , the accounting terms for what ' s owned , what ' s owed and what ' s left over , will be rather outdated . u . s . companies have 45 days from the end of a fiscal quarter to submit 10 - q reports , and 90 days from the end of a fiscal year for 10 - k reports . these filings usually don ' t arrive until weeks after the publication of earnings releases . so it ' s easy to overlook the additional information they provide , especially when it doesn ' t receive the kind of publicity that the earnings release does . yet the recent example of enron corp . - - another company that omits balance sheets from press releases - - provides evidence that investors who forgo the extra effort needed to find them do so at their own peril . enron , the largest energy trader , reported $ 1 . 01 billion in ` ` non - recurring ' ' costs in the third quarter from an expansion into water , telecommunications and retail - energy sales . the expense contributed to a $ 618 million loss for the quarter . these numbers were part of the houston - based company ' s income statement , a summary of sales , costs and expenses , and profits or losses during a specified time period . income statements are the cornerstone of any company ' s earnings release . billion - dollar numbers the release didn ' t even mention a larger figure that affected the balance sheet : a $ 1 . 2 billion drop in shareholders ' equity during the quarter resulting from the company ' s repurchase of 55 million shares from two partnerships , ljm cayman lp and ljm 2 co - investment lp , that helped finance projects . andrew fastow , who ran both partnerships , was ousted from his job as chief financial officer last week . chairman and ceo kenneth lay disclosed the repurchase in a subsequent conference call . such a one - two punch dealt a blow to investors ' fortunes . since oct . 17 , the day after the earnings release , enron ' s shares have fallen each day and have lost two - thirds of their value . the low of $ 10 . 90 yesterday was the lowest price since july 1992 . enron ' s third - quarter statement referred only to a loss on ` ` finance arrangements with a previously disclosed entity ' ' which contributed to $ 544 million of investment losses . the size of that item was later put at $ 35 million . the latter number amounts to just 3 . 5 percent of the overall figure for ` ` non - recurring ' ' costs , and less than 1 percent of the company ' s $ 47 . 6 billion in revenue for the quarter . growing debt burden the $ 1 . 2 billion figure is considerably larger not only in dollars , but also in percentage terms . enron had $ 11 . 74 billion of shareholders ' equity as of june 30 , according to the balance sheet in its second - quarter 10 - q filing . the reduction equaled more than 10 percent of that total . among other things , the balance sheet also shows that the company relied more heavily on debt financing during this year ' s first half . short - term debt , due in one year or less , doubled to $ 3 . 46 billion . long - term debt , maturing in more than one year , rose 9 . 4 percent to $ 9 . 36 billion . there ' s even more to the story of enron ' s indebtedness . the company guaranteed $ 3 . 3 billion in borrowing by osprey trust and marlin water trust , which bought some of its power plants . unless they pay off the debt by reselling the plants , the company may have to come up with the difference . nevertheless , any summary of a company ' s financial position provides a more complete picture than the income statement alone . this also holds true for companies whose finances are in better shape -

debt ratings an issue by wall street journal staff reporters john r . emshwiller and rebecca smith in los angeles and robin sidel and jonathan weil in new york 11 / 09 / 2001 the wall street journal a 3 ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) enron corp . reduced its previously reported net income dating back to 1997 by $ 586 million , or 20 % , mostly due to improperly accounting for its dealings with partnerships run by some company officers . the disclosure , contained in a securities and exchange commission filing , came even as the houston energy - trading company continued its merger talks with rival dynegy inc . dynegy , an independent power producer and utility owner , is looking at acquiring enron for roughly $ 7 billion to $ 8 billion , people familiar with the talks say . however , those talks could also be influenced by whether enron is further downgraded by major credit - ratings agencies . the total price being discussed would equate to about $ 10 an enron share , barely above where the stock is currently trading and far below the level of even two weeks ago . as of 4 p . m . in new york stock exchange composite trading yesterday , enron shares were down 7 . 1 % , or 64 cents , to $ 8 . 41 , a tenth of their 52 - week high of $ 84 . 875 . on the big board , dynegy traded at $ 36 . 50 , up $ 3 . 50 . shares of several energy - trading companies were up yesterday following a directive from federal regulators that the california state government pay an estimated $ 1 . 6 billion for past power purchases . in yesterday ' s sec filing , enron also made major adjustments in its reported assets , debt and shareholder equity back to 1997 . for instance , for the three - month period ended sept . 30 , enron lopped about $ 2 . 2 billion , or 19 % , off shareholder equity , reducing it to a total of $ 9 . 5 billion . previously , the company had disclosed a reduction of only $ 1 . 2 billion . the filing also said that enron discharged ben glisan , the company treasurer , and kristina mordaunt , the general counsel of enron ' s north america unit , in connection with investments they made in one of the officer - run limited partnerships . until yesterday , enron had insisted that mr . glisan wasn ' t associated with the officer - run partnerships . the company wouldn ' t explain why the the two had been discharged , and mr . glisan and ms . mordaunt couldn ' t be reached to comment . the sec filing is the latest chapter in a crisis that has engulfed the nation ' s biggest energy - trading company during the past month . during that time , enron has reported a big third - quarter loss , the replacement of its chief financial officer who ran two of the controversial partnerships , and an sec investigation . the sec filing raises further questions about enron ' s accounting procedures and disclosure policies . concerns over these matters are vexing investors and analysts , including those at major credit - rating agencies . the agencies downgraded enron debt during recent weeks and have the company on review for further downgrades . ralph pellecchia , credit analyst for fitch , said he couldn ' t predict what effect the sec filing would have on enron ' s credit rating , but he added that the document contained damaging disclosures . "" it ' s bad , "" he said . the enron sec filing also raises questions about the conduct of its outside auditor , arthur andersen llp , which reviewed the company ' s annual financial statements and certified them as consistent with accepted accounting principals . because of all the accounting adjustments "" the audit reports covering the year - end financial statements for 1997 - 2000 should not be relied upon , "" yesterday ' s sec filing said . an andersen spokesman called enron ' s restatement announcement "" an unfortunate situation "" but said the accounting firm is "" cooperating with the company . . . to bring resolution to these matters . "" he said he couldn ' t comment further because of client - confidentiality concerns . among the accounting turnabouts , enron said it had improperly accounted for two partnerships connected to michael kopper , a former managing director of the company ' s north america unit . the two partnerships were known as joint energy development investments lp , or jedi , and chewco investments lp . as reported , mr . kopper managed the general partner of chewco , which was formed in 1997 . jedi had been formed in 1993 by enron in partnership with the huge california public employees ' retirement system , or calpers . in 1997 enron , which operated jedi , bought out calpers ' interest for $ 383 million and immediately sold it to chewco , according to the sec filing . almost all the money for chewco ' s purchase came in loans from jedi and an unnamed financial institution , whose loan was guaranteed by enron . by having a supposed outside party in the form of chewco as a partner , enron treated jedi as an unconsolidated affiliate and kept hundreds of millions of dollars of partnership debt off its balance sheet . enron now acknowledges that treatment was wrong and that both jedi and chewco should have been consolidated starting in 1997 . taking that step retroactively resulted in a $ 396 million reduction in net income for the years 1997 to 2000 , the sec filing said . mr . kopper , who left enron in july to run the partnerships , didn ' t return a phone call seeking comment . in the past , he has declined to be interviewed . enron also retroactively consolidated some of the results of its dealings with a partnership called ljm cayman lp . that consolidation reduced 1999 and 2000 net income by $ 103 million . ljm and a similar but much larger partnership , called ljm 2 co - investment lp , were formed in 1999 by enron ' s then - chief financial officer andrew fastow , who was replaced last month . the two partnerships were run by mr . fastow and mr . kopper , according to the enron sec filing and private partnership documents . enron ' s sec filing said the company believes that mr . fastow sold his interests in the ljm partnerships in july to mr . kopper . mr . fastow has declined to be interviewed . several analysts said they were troubled that none of the earnings restatements were directly attributed to the much larger ljm 2 partnership . some also pointed to a sentence in the sec filing that said "" it is possible "" that continuing enron reviews will "" identify additional or different information concerning these matters . "" as such , "" there remains doubt about whether there is something else in the closet , "" said brian youngberg , energy analyst at edward jones in st . louis . the enron sec filing gave new information about the effect on company earnings of transactions related to the ljm partnerships . since 1999 , those transactions produced $ 577 . 8 million in pretax earnings , despite a $ 711 million pretax charge in this year ' s third quarter due to the termination of deals with several ljm 2 - related entities . the filing also estimated that mr . fastow received more than $ 30 million from the ljm partnerships . - - - mea culpa in the midst of talks to be acquired by dynegy , enron details accounting and other actions . - - will restate its financial results from 1997 through the third quarter of 2001 , reducing previously reported income by $ 586 million and boosting previously reported debt to $ 628 million at the end of 2000 - - concedes three entities run by company officials should have been included in its consolidated financial statements , based on generally accepted accounting principles - - fires ben glisan , managing director and treasurer , and kristina mordaunt , managing director and general counsel of an enron division - - establishes a special committee to review all transactions source : the company copyright ? 2000 dow jones section c does enron trust its new numbers ? it doesn ' t act like it by floyd norris 11 / 09 / 2001 the new york times page 1 , column 2 c . 2001 new york times company you ' d be better informed if , instead of listening to what we say , you watch what we do . ' ' that excellent advice was not issued by enron management , although it should have been . instead it came more than 30 years ago from john n . mitchell , president richard m . nixon ' s attorney general . enron ' s restatement of earnings yesterday did not go far enough to allow investors to understand all of what went on during the company ' s many strange transactions with related parties . it is now consolidating the results of some of its off - balance - sheet creations , though what happened in the most important ones remains a mystery . but the restatement should , at the least , cause investors and wall street analysts to realize they have been fooled by so - called pro forma earnings , which leave out unpleasant realities and ignore accounting rules . in january , enron told investors its ' ' recurring net income , ' ' as it calls its pro forma number , would be $ 1 . 70 to $ 1 . 75 a share this year . the company ' s share price rose to $ 82 when that forecast was made . remarkably , enron is still on course to hit that target . yesterday ' s restatement raised its nine - month earnings figure by a penny , to $ 1 . 36 . and yet enron appears to be willing to sell out for about $ 10 a share , or less than six times its reported profits , which still appear to be growing . why so little ? the answer may be that enron ' s board knows those numbers are not reliable measures of performance . enron ' s failure to disclose more about the still unconsolidated subsidiaries is an indication that the unreleased facts would not be reassuring . and enron cannot stay in business unless customers and investors believe it is financially solid . so it is willing to sell out for a fraction of what it appeared to be worth only weeks ago . don ' t call it a takeover . takeunder would be a better term . what set off enron ' s collapse ? it now appears to have been a mistake . enron says it added $ 1 billion to shareholder equity in 2000 and early this year in error . the mistake did nothing to improve enron ' s profits at the time , so it seems unlikely it was deliberate . had the mistake not been made , the reduction in shareholder equity it disclosed last month would have been $ 200 million , not $ 1 . 2 billion . that reduction scared investors into believing that enron ' s transactions with partnerships led by andrew fastow , its former chief financial officer , had been disastrous for the company . now it appears they may not have been so bad . but that fact is not very important now . enron ' s new disclosures indicate that perhaps 40 percent of its reported profits in 2000 came from dealings with the fastow partnerships . such profits may be legal under accounting rules , but there are good reasons to doubt how real they are . in fact , the accounting rule makers are even now pondering a question that may be important to enron . the body charged with dealing with new accounting issues got a rush question on oct . 23 - - the day before enron ousted mr . fastow - - about the accounting on transactions at a hypothetical ' ' big energy corporation ' ' where one subsidiary , a natural gas pipeline company , trades with another subsidiary , an energy trading entity . the question posed was whether a company can report profits made by one subsidiary while ignoring the losses of the other one . that company may or may not be enron . such games will not work anymore , at least for enron . it needs to be acquired because its customers are not willing to believe even its revised numbers . graph shows enron share prices since oct . 15 . copyright ? 2000 dow jones section c surest steps , not the swiftest , are propelling dynegy past enron by neela banerjee 11 / 09 / 2001 the new york times page 5 , column 1 c . 2001 new york times company the tortoise appears ready to overtake the hare . until they confirmed yesterday that they were in merger talks , the enron corporation and dynegy inc . were rivals within the new , rapidly evolving deregulated power industry . each embodied a sharply different approach to making money , attracting investors and winning over regulators . enron thrived on risk , hurling itself into projects and businesses largely untested by others , earning along the way a reputation for innovation and the acclaim of the investors and analysts who now so angrily shun it because of its murky accounting . dynegy is the slower , more cautious company , the younger sibling that carefully gleaned lessons from the example set by a brasher enron . dynegy ' s steady progress has now made it strong and solvent enough to contemplate a multibillion - dollar takeover of its erstwhile competitor . as one senior energy industry executive said , ' ' enron ' s trying to hit more triples and home runs , while dynegy tries for singles and doubles . ' ' kenneth lay , the enron chairman and chief executive who built an empire from two troubled gas pipeline companies - - and whose influential friends include president bush - - is the one who points to the bleachers . dynegy ' s chairman and chief executive , charles l . watson , is less well known but is well respected among stock analysts . he also started small , nurturing his energy trading and generating company - - which had $ 33 billion in revenue for the nine months ended sept . 30 - - from a natural gas trading concern he began in the mid - 80 ' s . when electricity markets around the united states were deregulated , the companies followed clearly divergent paths . utilities no longer necessarily generated power , and they and their larger industrial clients looked for good deals on the power being sold on the new wholesale markets for electricity . enron and dynegy traded and marketed energy . yet enron sold most of the power plants it owned and focused mainly on financial transactions rather than the actual physical delivery of power , a strategy that made the company a lot of money very fast . dynegy bought power plants instead and focused on being a reliable supplier of energy . it cashed in , too , on deregulation , but not as enron had . it stuck to its core energy business as its archrival branched into overseas operations , retail power marketing , a water business and a broadband venture , most of which have gone badly awry . mr . watson said in an interview earlier this year that a string of power plant acquisitions had kept his company diversified and balanced . ' ' we need a little bit everywhere , ' ' he said . ' ' enron is a financial player , but dynegy is more of a physical player . ' ' if enron ' s finances grew more confusing , dynegy seemed to offer clarity . if enron promised a lot , analysts said , dynegy played up its accomplishments . enron lobbied regulators and politicians very publicly , while dynegy kept things quiet and discreet . ' ' chuck watson is a pretty straight - talking guy , ' ' said christopher r . ellinghaus , a williams capital group analyst . because enron had such extravagant earnings promises to fulfill , some analysts said , it may have been tempted to hide its problems and losses with creative accounting . while dynegy avoided such a path , no one really expects mr . watson to gloat about his company ' s new , larger stature . enron may have been less a hare than a canary in the deregulation coal mine , and it is unclear who will take on that role now . ' ' dynegy had what could be called a second - mover advantage , ' ' said andre meade , head of commerzbank securities ' united states utility research . ' ' it seemed to be content to watch its larger rival up the street in houston , enron , go into a market . and if it was successful , dynegy then could go in with less money and make it work . ' ' copyright ? 2000 dow jones section c enron admits to overstating profits by about $ 600 million by richard a . oppel jr . and andrew ross sorkin 11 / 09 / 2001 the new york times page 1 , column 2 c . 2001 new york times company the enron corporation yesterday sliced more than half a billion dollars from its reported profits over the last five years , but its crosstown rival , dynegy inc . , still appeared to be willing to acquire enron , executives close to the merger talks said . worries about how bond rating agencies would react to the merger delayed announcement of the deal , the executives said . but the failure to announce a deal - - as well as the profit restatement - - caused enron ' s share price to fall . and volume in its core north american natural gas and electricity trading operation plunged 20 percent as other energy - trading companies , unnerved by enron ' s financial distress , steered business elsewhere . the boards of the two companies tentatively agreed late wednesday night to a deal in which dynegy would acquire enron for about $ 8 billion in stock , or roughly $ 10 a share . the deal would include an initial $ 1 . 5 billion cash infusion from chevrontexaco , which owns 27 percent of dynegy , and later an additional infusion of $ 1 billion . the sticking point to proceeding with the deal , according to the executives , is whether enron ' s credit rating will be reduced to ' ' junk ' ' status by the major credit rating agencies in reaction to enron ' s disclosures and its plan to be acquired by dynegy . dynegy and enron have provided pro forma statements of what a combined dynegy - enron would look like and asked standard & poor ' s and moody ' s investors service for an ' ' expedited review ' ' of the transaction . dynegy and chevrontexaco are also privately considering whether to offer a bigger cash infusion to buoy enron ' s credit rating - - now just two notches from falling below investment grade - - if the agencies look askance at the current deal . the companies are hoping for a response within the next day or two , the executives said . the executives also said dynegy was seeking further protections that would allow it to back out of the deal if new , adverse disclosures surfaced . shares of dynegy rose sharply yesterday , although it was not clear whether buyers believed that the company - - one - quarter the size of enron , in terms of revenues - - was getting a bargain or that enron ' s latest disclosures would lead to the deal ' s being abandoned . dynegy rose $ 3 . 50 , or 10 . 6 percent , to $ 36 . 50 , gaining back all of the ground lost on wednesday after news of the deal leaked . enron shares fell 64 cents , or 7 . 1 percent , to $ 8 . 41 . less than a year ago , enron traded for more than $ 84 a share , and the company was valued at nearly $ 70 billion . in a sweeping restatement of its profits , enron said that its actual net income for the years 1997 to 2000 was $ 591 million less than it had reported on its financial statements . in a filing with the s . e . c . , enron also indicated that part of last year ' s reported profits came from transactions with partnerships controlled by andrew s . fastow , who was the company ' s chief financial officer until he was ousted oct . 24 . enron said the transactions involving mr . fastow , which are part of the s . e . c . investigation , earned the former executive more than $ 30 million . the company also said it had fired its treasurer and the general counsel of one of its divisions , who both had invested in one of the partnerships . any deal would also face long and complex reviews by federal and state energy regulators , who would have to sort out a range of competitive issues in the still - young business of wholesale natural gas and electricity trading . among the agencies involved would be the federal energy regulatory commission , the federal trade commission and the justice department . some analysts expressed hope that enron ' s financial straits would encourage regulators to clear any deal , to relieve government officials of the prospect of dealing with the potential collapse of the nation ' s dominant energy - trading company . enron handles about a quarter of all power trading , and higher proportions in some important regional markets . ' ' if not for the dire condition of enron today , we are not certain an enron - dynegy merger would be possible due to antitrust concerns , ' ' said christopher r . ellinghaus , an analyst at williams capital . ' ' however , the effective industry bailout that the merger would represent would probably lead to some leniency from the f . t . c . , and would probably be looked at with some relief by the f . e . r . c . ' ' it was clear yesterday there would be opposition to the deal . ' ' if dynegy and enron were to get together , obviously the thing that would appeal to dynegy would be to combine the trading function of the two entities , and that in itself would provide greater market power , not less market power , ' ' said raymond plank , chairman of the apache corporation , one of the largest independent natural gas producers , based in houston . mr . plank said he hoped regulators would take a critical look at any deal . ' ' the thing they should take a look at is the concentration of market power that has led to excessive volatility , and as a result , once again is threatening north american gas producers . ' ' enron ' s restated profits almost wiped out its net income in 1997 , and reduced it for every year since . but the changes actually raised its reported profits so far this year by $ 5 million . the changes came largely from including results of two special purpose partnerships that it had treated as being independent - - companies called jedi and chewco , after characters in the ' ' star wars ' ' movies - - and of including a subsidiary of a partnership called ljml . that partnership , and another called ljm 2 , were run by mr . fastow . the remainder of the earnings reductions , totaling $ 92 million from 1997 through 2000 , came from what enron called ' ' prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications , ' ' which appear to have been changes previously recommended by arthur andersen , enron ' s auditors , but not made because the auditors were persuaded the amounts were immaterial . details of those charges were not disclosed , and enron said it might further alter its reporting as a special board committee continues its investigation of the partnership transactions . ' ' this is an unfortunate situation , ' ' said david tabolt , a spokesman for arthur andersen , which audited enron ' s books in all the years in question . ' ' issues have surfaced that have caused the company to restate its financial statements and advise investors that they should not rely on enron ' s financial statements or our audit reports . we are cooperating with the company and its special committee to bring resolution to these matters . ' ' while the restated financial statements consolidated the results of two partnerships and the ljml subsidiary , they did not fold the entire ljml partnership or the ljm 2 partnership into enron ' s financials . it is not clear how those partnerships performed . nor did they include some other related entities whose enron - guaranteed debts have aroused concern among investors . mr . fastow , enron ' s former chief financial officer , could not be reached for comment , his lawyer said . enron ' s downward cascade began after it reported third - quarter earnings on oct . 16 . its share price rose 67 cents , to $ 33 . 84 , that day , as the company said its ' ' recurring net income ' ' had met analyst expectations , even though write - offs led to a net loss . in a conference call that day , kenneth l . lay , enron ' s chairman , mentioned that the company had written down shareholder equity by $ 1 . 2 billion as it closed out its relationships with the ljm partnerships . in the following days , that figure became widely discussed as some investors concluded that the company had suffered a large loss that it was able to avoid reporting on the earnings statement . but enron said yesterday that reduction should have been only $ 200 million , with the remaining $ 1 billion reduction simply reversing prior errors made in 2000 and early this year . enron said it had set up procedures to monitor transactions with the ljm partnerships and assure they were proper . ' ' whether these controls were properly implemented ' ' is being investigated by the special board committee , the company said . that committee has retained william mclucas , a former director of enforcement for the s . e . c . , as well as accountants from deloitte kristina mordaunt , the general counsel of an enron division ; and kathy lynn , vice president of an enron division . the company said ms . lynn no longer worked for enron and that the company was ' ' terminating the employment ' ' of the other two . some industry officials said yesterday that a deal with dynegy was increasingly looking like a do - or - die prospect for enron , as other energy - trading companies began to back away from the company and take their business to other trading companies . while enron has a large network of natural gas pipelines and other profitable assets , by far its most valuable franchise is its energy - trading business in north america , which acts as an intermediary in more gas and electricity trades than any other company . yesterday , volume in that business dropped 20 percent . an enron spokesman said company traders attributed the drop to concerns about the s . e . c . investigation and the outcome of the merger talks with dynegy . enron also canceled a planned meeting with its creditors today in houston , executives said . the agenda for the meeting had been an extension of its $ 3 billion credit lines , but the merger talks superseded that discussion . photo : dynegy ' s chief executive , charles l . watson , is respected among stock analysts .

"" neither plans additional comments until a deal is struck or the talks fail . the statements came as enron said it is restating its finances as far back as 1997 to include losses related to a number of complex partnerships it created , including several being investigated by federal securities regulators . enron has been under heavy fire since oct . 16 , when it released third - quarter earnings that included losses related to two investment partnerships formerly run by its since - replaced chief financial officer . carol coale , an analyst with prudential securities in houston , is to meet with top dynegy executives today . she has a number of questions about a possible merger , including why dynegy wants to buy enron when its best resource , its people , could cross the street and turn in r ? sum ? s . she also wonders why ken lay , enron ' s chairman and chief executive , is apparently willing to sell enron at such a low price . "" what does he know that we don ' t know ? "" coale asked . but coale also got the sense dynegy executives are doing their homework and moving with caution , which she said is positive . a dynegy buyout of enron has the potential to be "" highly accretive "" to dynegy ' s bottom line depending on the price paid , said ronald barone , an analyst at ubs warburg in new york . "" the new company would be a global powerhouse , "" he said . "" there are significant synergies that can be realized to enhance value . "" shares in dynegy closed up $ 3 . 50 thursday to $ 36 . 50 . investors liked two opposite prospects , said jeff dietert , an analyst with simmons & co . international in houston . on the one hand , investors see potential for dynegy to add profits by buying enron , he said . but if no deal happens , they also see a chance for dynegy to take business away from a weakened enron . he expects any deal dynegy signs to give it an escape if the securities and exchange commission should conclude enron acted illegally . government regulators would have to review a merger , looking to see if too much market concentration would result . with a merger , dynegy would increase its trading and marketing share in the north american natural gas market from about 6 percent to about 21 percent , said john olson , an analyst with sanders harris morris in houston . for electricity , dynegy ' s numbers would go from about 6 percent to about 23 percent , he said . andre meade , an analyst with commerzbank securities in new york , doesn ' t believe regulators would find a market concentration problem . "" it ' s a pretty fractionalized industry with plenty of competition , "" he said . meade called an enron - dynegy merger "" a mixed bag , "" as it would let dynegy cut costs and lead the energy trading market . "" however , i don ' t think it ' s as easy as it sounds , "" he said , adding that a successful merger would take the correct incentives to convince enron ' s traders to work for the new company .

( i regret - - oh how i regret ! - - that i must disclose before proceeding further that investment funds i manage have , at this writing , exposure to enron stock , acquired at prices substantially above current markets . ) for canadians unfamiliar with enron and its place in u . s . energy markets , here is an introduction : voltaire summed up the entire 18 th - century deistic proof of the existence of god by saying , "" if god did not exist , it would be necessary to invent him . "" it ' s the same with enron . u . s . energy markets needed a prime mover . prior to enron , these markets ( other than crude oil ) were relatively primitive and inefficient . neither producers nor consumers had means to hedge their risks effectively , and long - term contracts were made - - if at all - - under circumstances of grossly inadequate information . the futures market for natural gas was spotty and unreliable , and no futures market for electricity existed . enter enron . in the past half - dozen years , enron became the greatest trading house for energy in the world . its willingness to make markets in energy futures in almost any amount transformed the markets for electric power and gave natural gas producers and consumers reliable hedging and financing opportunities , day in , day out . by putting its own capital on the line to make trades , enron created depth , liquidity and transparency in energy markets . so active were those markets that they gave price signals to all who would follow them . conspicuous among those who didn ' t were the policy - makers in california . had gov . gray davis and his top officials followed the developments in electricity futures , they would have realized the real nature of the risks facing consumers in the golden state . instead , they let a crisis develop , and then locked in long - term purchase contracts at all - time record - high prices just before they collapsed to normal levels . by some estimates , enron is on one side or the other of 25 per cent of all outstanding futures contracts in natural gas and electricity . since these contracts extend years ahead , and since the other parties to those trades are relying on enron ' s ability to cover its obligations , the risks to energy prices and supplies could be enormous if enron were to default . that still seems extremely improbable . contracts executed through the public futures markets have the financial protection of those exchanges for enron ' s "" counterparties "" ( the term for the other side of a futures contract ) . but enron has enormous exposure through direct deals that have no such protection . what has hammered enron ' s securities lately is the unfolding story of gigantic off - balance - sheet deals the company made with partnerships that included , astonishingly enough , the chief financial officer , who was finally forced to go on leave . these partnership deals were never really disclosed , except in obscure balance sheet notes that gave no indication of the scale of the deals or that a senior company officer was involved . why should investors who aren ' t owners of enron stock or bonds care ? because the past year has seen the biggest swings in natural gas and electricity prices in history , and some observers wonder whether enron ' s internal problems exacerbated those swings . worse , if enron has to withdraw from the markets , what about the billions in forward hedging contracts that producers and consumers have in place ? many u . s . energy producers locked in high prices by making huge forward sales . if those contracts are voided , defaults could spread through the system , throwing energy markets into chaos . there were enough problems in the energy - short u . s . even when enron was keeping the markets functioning . if the master market maker goes down , or is forced to curtail its operations , this winter could be a truly chilling experience for north americans . when bush and cheney aren ' t worrying about bin laden or anthrax , they may be worrying about enron . donald coxe is chairman of harris investment management in chicago and toronto - based jones heward investments . copyright ?

"" what we do know is that companies that gave shareholders rights did better than those that didn ' t in the 1990 s . . . so maybe if the companies that don ' t give shareholder rights gave them , their stock would do a lot better going forward , "" he said .

"" the valuation problem is complicated by enron ' s gigantic market share , far larger than the largest institutions have in the government bond , currency , or exchange traded commodities markets . even so , it is likely that enron ' s long and short positions do balance , as the company says , even though the revenue recognition and profitability may need tuning . the company ' s earnings and balance sheet restatement was reassuring , in that there was no restatement of the balance sheet or income statement in the trading business . dynegy ' s due diligence team and the arthur anderson auditors working on enron ' s books know they had better get it right . if dynegy had announced a package of asset purchases rather than a stock deal , you could have wondered whether they saw value in enron as a going concern . that means keeping the trading business going , although probably running it more carefully and transparently . also , this is probably a "" once in a corporate lifetime "" opportunity to put together a merger of such large companies with the likely quick approval of antitrust regulators . there was no chance that the federal reserve or any other government entity would or could step in to assume responsibility for liquidity in the traded energy markets . the fed ' s giving a pass on antitrust considerations is a low - cost way to head off any problem . and enron ' s pipelines , gas storage business , power plants , liquefied natural gas facilities , and other physical assets would be difficult to duplicate . they would sell for a significant premium to the book value on which the bondholders have first call . so enron ' s $ 13 bn of debt is most likely a good buy , and you are getting it at close to bankruptcy prices . it is probably a good idea to leave the bet on the takeover price of the equity to the professional risk arbs .

"" the potential is staggering . if the companies combined , they would create a $ 21 bn behemoth in the energy sector with unparallelled energy - marketing skills and financial resources , "" says christopher ellinghaus , an analyst at williams capital group . dynegy ' s gas business is currently less than half the size of enron ' s , and also trails duke and mirant . it is only one - eighth as big as enron in power trading , where aep , mirant , duke , el paso and reliant also hold big positions . like enron , dynegy has been a market favourite , exploiting growth opportunities in the unregulated and rapidly developing wholesale natural gas and electricity markets in the us . it has also been looking to expand its wholesale operations well beyond a uk presence . dynegy ' s online trading platform , dynegydirect - which helped raise the company ' s recent third - quarter earnings 22 per cent to $ 286 m - is seen as a good fit with enron online . the two platforms allow customers to buy wholesale gas liquids at the click of a mouse . there are other links . chuck watson , dynegy chief executive , is a friend of jeff skilling , who quit as enron chief executive officer in august . dynegy is also an important trading partner for enron , demonstrated by the fact that enron has helped bail out its new suitor in the past from potential trading losses . that counterparty relationship may give dynegy a powerful incentive to preserve enron in order to maintain stability in the energy markets . analysts say there would be a big shake - up in the energy markets were enron to fail , although some say the volatility may be only short term . a takeover would not be the only way for rivals such as dynegy to capitalise on enron ' s weakness , however . dynegy , el paso and duke energy are already assessing potential opportunities to pick up enron ' s share of the market should it disappear . many are trading partners with enron , and some , like aquila , have been reducing their exposure as counterparties as the enron crisis deepens . however , any dynegy takeover of enron would invite close regulatory scrutiny . most analysts believe a deal could be done , but approval could take more than a year due to market issues and the complexity of the two companies . some analysts said a deal might be perceived as a necessary bail - out for the trading industry , and therefore welcomed by the federal trade commission and the federal energy regulatory commission . others , however , raised serious concerns about the prospect of a bid by dynegy . although dynegy had told investors it was ready to make large acquisitions or mergers in the us and overseas , they had not expected such a transforming deal . mr watson told analysts in october that he was considering deals which could add generation assets , gas pipeline and storage infrastructure , entire utilities and communication assets . carol coale , an analyst at prudential securities , says there would be other concerns surrounding any deal with enron . "" strategically and culturally , the companies do not fit well together , "" she says , adding that enron has been moving to offload units while dynegy has preferred to hang on to assets . carol levenson at gimme credit . com , an independent provider of credit research , says dynegy would be taking "" a big risk "" to its credit ratings by even being associated with enron ' s liabilities : "" dynegy is utterly dependent on its credit ratings and the confidence of the market and its trading partners to do business profitably . "" analysts took some comfort , however , in the possible involvement of the newly merged chevrontexaco , which owns a 27 per cent stake in dynegy . additional reporting by andrew edgecliffe - johnson . ( c ) copyright financial times ltd . all rights reserved . http : / / www . ft . com . copyright ? 2000 dow jones it would also would have a spill - over effect on other energy traders if investors backed away from the entire sector . the 50 to 100 large counter - parties that do business with enron daily could continue to trade without the market ' s biggest participant and even its trading platform ; telephone trading remains a substantial part of the business . but without enron , a liquidity crisis would probably ensue , disrupting energy markets and undermining business for many of its competitors . "" there ' s a fair amount of incentive for counter - parties to hang in there and not contribute directly into pushing ( enron ) over the brink , "" says christine uspenski , energy analyst at schwab capital markets . so the majority has chosen stability over a bigger share of what would surely become a riskier market . they have continued to do business with enron on much the same terms they had before october 16 , when enron disclosed a surprise balance sheet adjustment that brought to the fore long - simmering questions about its transparency . analysts had long advised investors to look past those questions . after all , with the launch of enron ' s online platform in 1999 , trading volumes had soared as the number of products traded over the internet grew to almost 2 , 000 , ranging from weather derivatives to coal . enron ' s revenue more than doubled to $ 101 bn from 1999 to 2000 . many admitted they were unsure how enron made its money . not only had the company so dramatically transformed itself from a traditional pipeline company but it had moved increasingly into unsupervised areas that made it harder to scrutinise enron ' s finances . "" it became a new age holding company , "" says paul kedrosky , who teaches strategy and corporate governance at the university of british columbia . "" as long as the company performed , people were willing to forgive what was obviously horrific disclosure . "" those people included not only share market investors but also those in the business of buying and selling energy commodities . they needed goods and enron delivered more natural gas and electricity than anyone else , often at better prices . it was the first stop for utilities who lacked sufficient generation facilities to keep the lights on for their customers . they would go to the open market and purchase electricity , much of the time from enron . those that use natural gas to power their generation facilities obtained that through the open market as well . many have locked themselves into long - term contracts with enron that they cannot get out of - and they would be the ones with most to lose if enron went under . but those who were originally most spooked by the prospect of business without enron - the energy traders - seem to have accepted the reality that enron will most likely never dominate the markets as it had in the past . analysts and traders say the trading markets themselves have remained stable throughout enron ' s troubles even as the risk of uncertainty has increased . "" no one knows their positions or how they ' re hedged in the market , or how they might have to cover their positions , "" one energy trader said yesterday . even though enron had been hailed as the innovator in building these markets to their current state of sophistication , it has been forced over the past few weeks to act increasingly like a newcomer . however , analysts say some of enron ' s partners in the us and europe are demanding enron provide evidence of the availability of cash or security that can be called on quickly . enron ' s main competitors are now able offer better prices , and - while still not openly seeking to undermine enron - are undercutting its business as they report new customers and higher volumes . but , so far , no major counter - party has changed its terms with the company . "" out of respect for enron ' s presence , my sense is the industry has tried to give them the benefit of the doubt to see if they can resolve this situation , "" says michael zimmer , of law firm baker & mckenzie . see lex .

"" we believe that the information we have made available addresses a number of the concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the sec ( securities and exchange commission ) about these matters , "" said ken lay , enron ' s chairman and chief executive , yesterday , adding that the group would continue to respond to investors ' requests for information . the group ' s banks , due to meet today , want to secure $ 3 . 3 bn in unsecured credit lines drawn down in the past month . but they may not be able to renegotiate the terms unless enron ' s situation worsens sufficiently to trigger a default . jp morgan chase and citigroup , which have made $ 1 bn in secured loans to enron , are also understood to want to syndicate them to spread the risk , as nervousness increases . in a regulatory filing , enron said it had restated accounts from 1997 to the third quarter of this year , leading to an increase of $ 628 m in debt for the year 2000 , and changes in net income up to the third quarter of this year . enron ' s stock fell a further 5 per cent in morning trading - to $ 8 . 61 - and stands at barely a tenth of its level at the end of last year . the group ' s bonds rose only 4 points to 78 cents in the dollar reflecting scepticism about a rescue deal with dynegy . lex , page 22 enron in crisis , page 27 .

"" dynegy and enron together are two of the biggest players in the trading space . it ' s a great concentration of power , "" said raymond plank , chairman of apache corp . , a houston natural gas producer . "" we don ' t see any advantage to that . "" if the dynegy deal is approved , the purchase price would come to just over $ 10 per share , based on current market values . in august 2000 , enron ' s stock hit $ 90 a share , but the price fell steadily from that peak and has plummeted in the weeks since the losses from its partnership deals were disclosed . enron ' s stock closed yesterday at $ 8 . 41 , down 64 cents . enron handles about one - quarter of all energy trades , quoting prices and buying and selling commodities . while some of these transactions set the price of oil , natural gas , electricity other energy products , far more commonly the trades are financial deals between traders speculating on energy prices , or companies seeking insurance to limit the costs of energy purchases . energy companies and trading firms are working to reduce their vulnerability if enron were to fail . "" the inability to quantify possible risks is causing people to stay at arms length from enron now , "" said louis b . gagliardi , an analyst with john s . herold inc . plank said traders "" have been trying to neutralize their books to the impact of a potential failure on enron ' s part . we were able to get out of almost every trade [ involving enron ] . "" not everyone has been able to do it . "" but plank said energy markets are large enough to handle shocks . "" markets would be pretty volatile in natural gas , power and oil "" if enron had to pull back from trading , gagliardi said . "" but we ' d get back to normal pretty quickly . "" bond - rating companies have sharply cut their ratings on enron ' s bonds since these disclosures , and its debt is now one step above junk status , by some ratings . analysts said that if enron ' s bond rating fell below investment grade , they expect it to set in motion a forced sale of enron assets held by the partnerships . two of the partnerships , named marlin and osprey , have a combined indebtedness of $ 3 . 4 billion , said ralph pellechia , an analyst at fitch inc . , a bond - rating firm . that debt is to investors who purchased assets from enron , including a water system in britain and other holdings . if enron ' s bond rating crashes , the assets presumably would be sold and enron would have to make up any remaining obligation to debt holders by delivering its stock to the partnerships , pellechia said . given the drop in enron ' s stock price , that might not be possible .

"" a massive restatement like this doesn ' t look good . but since enron was already under such scrutiny , it ' s really not much of a surprise , "" said christopher ellinghaus , an analyst with williams capital in new york .

"" enron ' s new assessment of its financial condition slashed its total net income for that nearly four - year period by $ 586 million , or about 20 % , to $ 2 . 3 billion . the biggest change was a $ 250 - million reduction in net income for 1999 . the enron - dynegy merger talks involve a stock swap valuing enron at about $ 10 a share , or about $ 8 billion , according to sources familiar with the negotiations . chevrontexaco corp . , which owns nearly 27 % of dynegy , would pour $ 1 . 5 billion in cash into enron up front , with $ 1 billion to follow at the close of the transaction . dynegy would assume $ 12 . 8 billion in enron debt , which does not include the off - balance - sheet partnerships , the sources said . enron chairman and chief executive kenneth l . lay would remain on the board of the merged company but would not have day - to - day responsibilities , the sources said . dynegy chairman and chief executive chuck watson would assume those jobs at the combined company , and dynegy president stephen bergstrom would become president , they said . there is no guarantee that an agreement will be reached , and if it is , such a merger would face a lengthy and difficult review by federal regulators . the potential merger would have its problems , some analysts said . dynegy risks losing enron ' s most important asset , its energy traders , who can easily migrate to other energy trading firms in the houston area , said andre meade , head of u . s . utilities research for commerzbank securities . dynegy , like enron , needs a good credit rating and the ability to sell assets and issue stock to conduct its trading businesses , said carol levenson , an analyst with gimmecredit . com . a thumbs - down by the stock market could seriously jeopardize dynegy ' s financial flexibility , she said . although enron management has repeatedly emphasized that its core energy trading and marketing business remains sound , the company ' s severe cash crunch has hurt . enron ' s online trading operation has lost business in recent days . graphic : enron rescuer ?

2000 dow jones source : world reporter ( tm ) enron , the debt - stricken energy trading group , could be forced to sell its main british assets under the terms of an $ 8 bn takeover being considered by dynegy , its smaller rival . the two companies confirmed yesterday that they were in talks about a takeover , which would see houston firm dynegy , about a fifth of the size of its target , pay a "" fire - sale "" price worth about a tenth of enron ' s $ 70 bn value a year ago . the outcome would be a humiliation for enron , amer ica ' s largest energy trader , which was reportedly the biggest corporate contributor to the republican party and the presidential campaign last year . it has been forlornly courting cash injections from groups such as shell in the past few days to keep it afloat . enron ' s shares have lost 90 % of their value this year , going into free fall in the past two weeks as it sacked finance director andrew fastow for unusual partnership transactions carried out off - balance sheet . these forced it to take a $ 1 bn charge and cut shareholder equity by $ 1 . 2 bn . two other senior officials , including enron ' s treasurer , were fired yesterday following their involvement in the murky fastow deals , which are being investigated by the securities and exchange commission . pressure to conclude the deal swiftly ahead of an important meeting today between enron and its creditors mounted as the once dominant energy trader was forced to restate its earnings and substantial debts for the past four years , amid fears its bonds would soon be given junk status . chevrontexaco , the oil group which owns 27 % of dynegy , would inject up to $ 2 . 5 bn if the deal goes ahead . enron , also based in houston , owns wessex water , for which it paid pounds 1 . 4 bn in 1998 , and gas - fired power stations in britain , including the high - performing 1900 mw teesside plant . it recently announced deals to run the energy management operations of sainsbury and guinness . dynegy is paying pounds 421 m for bg ' s gas storage business , a deal expected to be concluded next month , but , renowned for its "" stingy "" financial management , it has shied away from buying a series of british power stations on offer because of inflated prices . copyright ? 2000 dow jones at the end of 2000 , enron ' s debt was $ 10 . 86 billion , $ 628 million more than previously reported . by not disclosing the debt earlier , enron presumably maintained a stronger credit rating and was able to vastly increase the size of its core operations - trading natural gas and electricity on wholesale markets . and while enron kept certain details about its finances secret , the company ' s stature as the crown jewel among energy traders grew . investors from wall street to main street sought a piece of the action as enron reported bigger and bigger profits and executives boasted they would successfully apply their energy trading strategies to other markets as well , including steel and broadband communications . however , after a decade in which enron firmly established itself as the nation ' s no . 1 natural gas and power marketing company , things have not gone according to plan lately and the former high - flyer has experienced a remarkably fast fall from grace . enron ' s stock price began a steady descent 10 months ago when its nascent high - speed internet unit failed to live up to the hype . the downward momentum was further propelled by difficulties collecting money from power customers in india . then , in the past three weeks , enron ' s share price plummeted fast and furiously as the company announced a $ 618 million third quarter loss , ousted its chief financial officer and undertook an apparently fruitless scramble for cash to remain an independent entity . several news organizations were reporting that dynegy was negotiating to buy enron for $ 8 billion in stock , but that the tentative deal could still fall apart . besides dynegy , companies mentioned as possible suitors included general electric ' s ge capital unit and royal dutch / shell group . on thursday , both dynegy and enron released statements confirming they were in talks , but declined to provide any details . the new york times , the wall street journal and the houston chronicle , among others , reported thursday that dynegy is considering paying about $ 8 billion in stock for enron , citing people familiar with the matter . chevrontexaco corp . , which has a 27 percent stake in dynegy , would provide enron an immediate cash infusion of $ 1 billion , the papers reported . enron ' s lay would not be given any formal management position in the combined company , although he would have a seat on its board , the journal reported . enron said it released the revised earnings so that investors could "" appropriately value the strength of our core businesses . "" "" we believe that the information we have made available addresses a number of the concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the sec about these matters , "" said kenneth lay , enron ' s chairman and chief executive the company also fired treasurer ben glisan and a lawyer , kristina mordaunt , on thursday . last month , enron ousted chief financial officer andrew fastow , who was in charge of some of the partnerships being probed by the sec . jeff skilling , enron ' s former chief executive who left in august , has been called to testify before the sec , although it ' s unclear when . wall street analysts admitted they were stunned by the rapid demise of enron , but said a merger with dynegy would help improve enron ' s credibility . still , prudential securities analyst carole coale remained puzzled as to "" why dynegy ' s management would want to take on the uncertainties and potential liabilities associated with a merger with enron .

' s ( ene ) shadow and acquire it . energy companies and analysts are united in one sentiment , though : a merger may be the only way to keep enron from going under and possible harming u . s . energy markets overall . enron and dynegy are both dominant natural gas and electricity marketers in the u . s . , and meshing enron ' s trading expertise with dynegy ' s power plants would seem the recipe for success . but there are too many unknowns at this point to speculate in much detail on the topic , analysts and energy companies said .

( begin videotape ) fred katayama , cnnfn correspondent ( voice - over ) : enron delivered another bombshell on a day when wall street was anticipating a merger announcement . the tarnished trader of energy drastically restated its earnings to include losses from partnerships now under investigation . enron is reducing its net income since 1997 by nearly $ 600 million . the company said it is consolidating the results of a few partnerships that had been left off the balance sheet . enron would pump assets into a partnership , then have the partnership borrow money so that the debt was kept off of its books . consolidating the partnerships also boosted enron ` s debt by more than $ 2 . 5 billion . ron barone , ubs warburg : if they lose their investment grade on their debt , the possibility exists that they may have to pay off over $ 3 billion either in cash or enron stock . katayama : enron fired its treasurer and a lawyer who it believes had invested in a partnership run by its former chief financial officer , andrew fastow ( ph ) . the sec is investigating the two partnerships set up by fastow . chairman kenneth lay said in a statement , we believe that the information we have made available addresses a number of the concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the sec about these matters . andre meade , commerzbank securities : the disclosure probably raises as many questions as it answers and what enron , what enron ` s trying to do is or what enron has done . katayama : enron stock slumped further and dynegy ( url : http : / / www . dynegy . com / ) rose on the news . investors were disappointed because they had hoped dynegy would announce it would buy its beleaguered rival . ( end videotape ) katayama : now some analysts say uncertainty hangs over any deal . dynegy will have to recalculate enron ` s worth based on the restated numbers and as for those restated numbers , it may not be the last of those restatements . that ` s because , in this current case , today ` s disclosure concerned only three entities . enron has done deals with more than 30 partnerships . ali . velshi : fred , tell me about these partnerships . is this common ? katayama : other companies have these limited partnerships but the difference is the scope of enron . say it deals with more than 30 of them . plus they ` re extremely complex . even wall street analysts said they couldn ` t figure them out . and you don ` t have a chief financial officer of your company running some of these partnerships that are doing business with your company . velshi : let ` s talk about enron stock . this used to be a darling stock . it ` s trading $ 1 . 40 off its 52 - week low . in fact at this moment , it ` s one tenth of its 52 - week high . katayama : right . you know , that stock used to be as you say , a darling of wall street . it traded almost like a tech stock . because here was this pipeline company in texas that all of a sudden was into fiber optics , was into broadband and it traded like a tech stock . it also fell like a tech stock . that stock is down 73 percent over the last month , down 89 percent year to date and was down 10 days in a row in october . velshi : let ` s talk about dynegy . last night on this show the news came out that dynegy was going to pump some money into enron and that over the course of the next 12 hours , that became discussions on a merger and a partnership . i don ` t want to use the word partnership . tell me what ` s likely to happen there . katayama : well , the thing is , wall street was really anticipating , based on yesterday ` s build up , that we get an announcement today saying the two companies would merge , that dynegy would buy enron , possibly for 7 , 8 billion . but a lot of analysts say one , dynegy wants to recalculate those numbers based on those restatements and two , even if there is a deal , enron will get zero premium or very little because there ` s very little negotiating room . it ` s got $ 13 billion of debt and all these troubles behind it . velshi : any indication of when we ` re going to hear about this restating and what we ` re going to see happen out of it ? that ` s always bad news when you ` ve got to restate for that far back . katayama : and it always hangs on a stock . you remember it happened to cendant ( url : http : / / www . cendant . com / ) . you remember it happened to sunbeam ( url : http : / / www . sunbeam . com / ) . the thing is , it ` s probably going to unravel over weeks and it ` s not going to be any time soon and that may also mean any deal may be dragged down . that ` s a problem , because what are enron ` s assets ? traders , human capital . and in times of uncertainty , human capital goes to other companies and texas has a lot of energy trading companies . velshi : fred , thanks very much for being with us . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . enron shareholder derivative suit filed 11 / 08 / 2001 pr newswire ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , pr newswire ) chicago , nov . 8 / prnewswire / - - the following statement was issued by krislov & associates , ltd : two shareholders of enron have filed a derivative suit in federal court in texas alleging that certain directors of enron breached their fiduciary duties to the company . the plaintiffs are represented by clinton krislov , michael karnuth , and michael rosenblat , of krislov & associates , chicago , illinois and michael bradford , of benckenstein & oxford , baumont , texas . the suit was filed on behalf of enron , to redress damages to the company from enron ' s investments in limited partnerships which were controlled by andrew fastow , enron ' s then chief financial officer , and approved by enron ' s board of directors . these transactions resulted in losses to enron estimated to be at least $ 35 million and a reduction in shareholders ' equity of at least $ 1 . 2 billion . the suit alleges that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties of loyalty and due care that they owed to enron and its stockholders . attorney krislov was quoted : "" they took a great company and nearly destroyed it through financial manipulation . maybe we can get some of it back for the company and its shareholders .

"Subject: conn . coal plants as most of you know , nrg ' s proposed purchase of two coal plants in conneticut ( ui ' s territory ) was recently cancelled due to regulatory issues at ferc . the purchase and sale transaction between wisvest and nrg was originally entered into almost two years ago . the proposed purchase price of $ 350 million for 1000 mw of coal was a "" bargain price "" at the time due to environmental risks that are specific to the state of ct . over the past 2 - 3 years , the state of conneticut has threatened to have these coal plants shut down due to pollution issues and wisvest was concerned enough about this risk that they "" puked "" the plants to nrg for $ 350 / kw in early 2000 . at a minimum , it is expected that $ 100 - 150 / kw of scr and / or scrubbers will be required at these facilities to appease the ct regulatory bodies . my strong view is that , as a practical matter , the plants cannot be shut down or the lights would go out in ct . the area where the plants are located is quite possibly the most congested area in the entire eastern interconnect . the load pocket is significantly short mw and transmission import capability is inadequate to serve the load in this area . in a true "" locational marginal price "" environment , the prices would likely be similar to zone j in new york currently , pricing in nepool is generally socialized with congestion costs spread equally to all loads , regardless of who causes the congestion . in the recently proposed "" single ne rto "" model , it is about 80 % certain that the pjm "" locational marginal price "" market model will be implemented sometime between mid - 2003 and mid - 2004 . at that point in time , consumers in the congested areas of nepool ( in - city boston and ct ) will be exposed to higher energy prices , while consumers in maine , new hampshire , and rhode island should see lower prices . given the facts above , coupled with traditional asset companies too long to show good bids for incremental assets , i think ews should pursue discussions with wisvest immediately and attempt to buy these coal plants at what could be extremely favorable economics relative to our forward curve in nepool and our bullish view for relative pricing at the asset "" node "" . if we could buy these plants for approx $ 250 / kw with $ 150 / kw of environmental upgrades , the resulting "" all - in "" ( depr , fixed & variable o & m , fuel costs , nox , so 2 , capital reserve , interest ) 7 x 24 plant cost would be approx . $ 34 - 36 / mwh . this is lower than our energy only socialized nepool curve . additional upside is derived from positive basis , icap , ancillary services , emissions allowances , and long term requirements sales to lse ' s . lavo and louise - this could be the "" alberta ppa "" for 2002 . lots of "" hair "" but lots of upside . any thoughts ?"	0

"Subject: bc hydro interview 5 / 21 / 01 sources have conducted the following "" off - the - record "" interview with a bc hydro executive . executive summary ? bc hydro projected capacity ? bc hydro / liberal government ' s export policy ? bc hydro expanded capacity projects bc hydro capacity the individual stated that bc hydro is convinced it has sufficient capacity to supply british colombia through 2005 , even if faced with increasing demand from business expansion . he stated that bc hydro ' s long - term contracts to supply power to the grid in the western us amounted to only 1 % of bc hydro ' s capacity . therefore , the company likely would continue to be active in the spot market through powerex , the company ' s "" main revenue generator . "" for example , according to a company report , bc hydro benefited from a revenue increase of $ 2 . 876 billion canadian for the first 9 months of fiscal 2001 , largely due to spot market trading . bc hydro exports bc hydro feels the new liberal government likely will "" make a concerted effort to expand capacity "" in british colombia . likewise , since the liberal government will be "" business - oriented , "" the bc hydro official expects the government to promote increased exports of power to the us . however , the individual cautioned that there would likely be a public relations battle on this point , as "" people don ' t necessarily favor increasing capacity to produce energy for export . "" this is due to broad - based environmental opposition to building more plants . therefore , in the long - term bc hydro ' s new projects will favor "" green alternatives "" such as dam expansion and biomass , thermal and solar plants over gas - fired plants . the spokesman stated that the liberal party intends to go forward with its campaign promise to remove bc hydro ' s monopoly on power . if and when this happens , relations between the company and the government are expected to "" quickly sour . "" bc hydro capacity projects bc hydro is pursuing a number of new projects to expand / improve generation capacity , including : ? seven - mile dam - - bc hydro will likely add a 213 mw turbine to the 3 units already in place ? revelstoke dam - - bc hydro is "" looking very seriously "" at adding a 500 mw unit to the 4 units already in place . there is also the potential to add a 5 th 500 mw unit , though this is not being considered at this time . ? site c dam - - a plan for a 960 mw dam was shelved in the 1980 s due to environmental concerns , but now appears to once again be a "" viable option . "" though bc hydro reportedly has no definite plans to pursue this option at this time , the individual said that constructing the dam would be more valuable now than it was in the 1980 s , and that resurrecting the plan would be a bc hydro decision . ? burrard thermal plant - bc hydro has invested $ 250 million to upgrade generation systems to reduce emissions . calpine has bought a 240 mw gas - fired co - generation plant called campbell river on vancouver island . this plant is "" in the final stages of testing and is already generating . "" calpine plans to bring the plant online commercially "" in the next few weeks . "" bc hydro will buy power from the plant for use on vancouver island . this is part of a plan to make vancouver island self - sufficient in electricity . another "" key plank "" in this plan is the port alberni plant , a 250 mw , independently - owned plant that is being sold to bc hydro . the plant reportedly will be online in two years and will supply vancouver island ."	0

Subject: eletrobolt review john : the following points outline the current status of the project for our discussion at 2 : 30 pm ( houston ) : budget : the attached spreadsheet outlines the current status of the budget as compared to previous reports . the basic status is that we have $ 4 million in unallocated contingency and are basically on budget . sales process : we have received one indicative proposal from perez companc to purchase 50 % of the project equity in the asset company at approximately $ 3 million below book . this offer is only for the asset company and does not include any transfer of the upside of the marketing company . total has indicated that they will give us an offer next week , but this has been delayed several times . we are currently scheduled to complete the process with perez companc prior to year - end , but the schedule is aggressive . opic financing : the main finance agreement should be complete by early next week . we have worked with opic over the last few days to change certain parts of the deal structure to accelerate the process . opic is now indicating more willingness to work towards a year - end closing . the financing would represent $ 190 million in financing out of a total capital budget of approximately $ 282 million . construction financing structure : all construction costs for the project are currently financed through an off - balance sheet / on - credit vehicle with westlb as the lead bank in the group . the financing vehicle contemplates the take - out of the vehicle upon the completion of construction . the definition is in accordance with the construction contract . final completion of construction will not be completed until late december or early january in accordance with the construction contract due to the final completion of the water treatment facilities . we are currently using temporary facilities to run the plant . enron equity : under the current process , enron would need to contribute approximately $ 45 million in equity in the final capital structure of the project assuming the indicative offer we have from perez companc . the basic issue is the timing of the opic financing and equity syndication closing and the westlb take - out . commercial operations : upon the completion of testing of the eight unit next week , we are planning to declare the start date under the petrobras agreement such that we can begin receiving the guaranteed payment . the conflict created with this action is that this could create problems with westlb under the construction financing vehicle . the contract is clear that the take - out must occur upon completion in accordance with the construction contract which shall not have ocurred . however , the banks have stated in the past that they did not contemplate taking operating risk . we are working with the finance agreement to ensure that we have a coordinated strategy and story for the banks to keep them comfortable . however , there is a risk that the banks will push for a take - out during this period . turbine : we are currently evaluting the purchase of a turbine ( only the engine ) which is required to be on - site for operational purposes . this is not a ninth turbine generating set as we had previously discussed . the plan to date has been to lease this unit from ge . however , we were presented an offer to buy a used unit with significantly better economics and operating conditions than the lease . with our current status in the budget , we believe that we can accomplish this and still be under the original construction budget as outlined in the attached table . we are currently expecting to receive a $ 6 . 8 million tax rebate , we have been able to defer $ 2 . 5 million in expenditures contemplated in the original budget ( still included above ) and we have unallocated contingency of $ 4 million . thanks , brett	0

"Subject: fw : onondaga louise / dave : we have been talking to accounting over the past several days regarding onondaga as i mentioned in our meeting yesterday . for whatever reason , our interest in onondaga ( through the cash flow interest agreement ) is viewed by accounting as a receivable . from a commercial standpoint , this is incorrect , but at the end of the day , it doesn ' t really matter . billy ' s e - mail below basically states that because of how the onondaga interest has been classified , we should reduce the $ 7 . 9 million by the $ 1 . 1 million payment received last week , but then readjust the value of the asset . based on our internal valuation , and based on the written indication we received this week from a prospective purchaser , adjusting the value of the "" receivable "" to $ 10 million ( after application of the $ 1 . 1 million payment received ) would be very conservative . this would net a gain of $ 3 . 1 million for q 3 . with your concurrence , i will work with billy to support the adjustment of onondaga to $ 10 million ( and therefore the gain of $ 3 . 1 million ) . i will advise him to credit the gain to my profit center unless you tell me otherwise . please let me know if you have any questions . regards , ben - - - - - original message - - - - - from : fleenor , william sent : wednesday , september 19 , 2001 5 : 57 pm to : jacoby , ben subject : re : onondaga ben , based upon the review of the cashflow interest agreement , partnership agreement and numerous discussions with internal accountants we have determined that it is inappropriate to recognize the cash payment received as income . the basis that is carried on our books currently ( approx . $ 7 . 9 mm ) represents a long - term receivable that resulted from the tracking account arrangement under the original gas supply agreement between ena and oclp . in addition , this asset does not qualify for the mtm or fair value accounting models . the payment received from oclp based on the cashflow interest agreement should reduce the long term receivable that is currently recorded on our books . however , it is also our understanding that in the prior year a management decision was made to reduce / write - off $ 8 million of this long - term receivable based upon the best information available at the time . as stated below our internal sales efforts now support the conclusion that the prior year write down was more than it should have been . this would suggest that we need to effectively adjust the write down of the asset to reflect what we truly believe is collectible . this will be considered a change in accounting estimate will flow through the current quarter earnings if management makes the decision that this asset was incorrectly written down in the prior year . this basically gets you the the same accounting treatment as mtm . a few things need to be noted : 1 ) support will need to be provided that substantially supports the adjustment of our valuation of this asset . please provide this to me 2 ) you will have to resolve the geography of the income that results from the increase in the asset . supposedly corp took the write down . . . . may cause problems . 3 ) somebody will have to accept responsibility for the valuation exposure that this will create . it is my understanding that rac and credit are not involved . 4 ) we need to be able to explain what basis we used in determining the write down in prior year . we will probably get questioned by aa . please call me if you would like to discuss . regards , billy - - - - - original message - - - - - from : jacoby , ben sent : tuesday , september 18 , 2001 9 : 37 pm to : fleenor , william ; vos , theresa subject : onondaga please book the payment received from onondaga as q 3 income . in this morning ' s meeting with louise , i have advised her that our internal valuation and sales efforts support this payment being taken as income . please advise as i need to update her tomorrow . thanks much . ben"	0

"Subject: overview of investor conference call today , enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview of the company . here ' s an update of what we discussed during the call . we told investors that we ' re doing everything we can to protect their interests and to regain their confidence . our focus remains on our credit quality , balance sheet and liquidity , which are essential for our continued success and expansion of our wholesale businesses . it took more than a few weeks to get where we are today . here ' s a snapshot of significant events that led to our current situation : - - in hindsight , we definitely made some very bad investments in our non - core businesses over the past several years . those include investments in azurix , india and brazil . they have performed far worse that we could have ever imagined when we made these investments ; - - because of these bad investments , we ' ve become over - leveraged as a company . the negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the extensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet ; - - we also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of investor confidence , which has been very damaging ; - - we ' ve been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard - to - understand financial and operating disclosures ; and - - on top of it all , we discovered errors in our financial statements , as discussed in our 8 - k filing last week , that required a restatement of previously reported earnings . we ' ve taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three areas : core businesses , non - core businesses , and businesses under review . core businesses our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant earnings and cash flows for the company . they ' re our competitive advantage . these include : - - natural gas pipeline businesses ; - - gas and power businesses in north america and europe ; - - retail businesses in north america and europe ; and - - coal businesses in north america and europe . the events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on our projected fourth quarter profitability . it ' s too early to tell at this time what impact this might have on our operating results . we are considering these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002 . i also remain optimistic that the actions we ' ve taken over the past couple of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity concerns . according to our business unit leaders , we have definitely seen improvement in our counterparty relationships . non - core businesses our non - core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband division . we have invested more than $ 8 billion in these businesses , and the return from them has been dismal . we have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses . we already have more than $ 800 million in assets contracted for sale this year . they include ceg rio , a gas ldc in brazil ; ecoelectrica , a power plant and lng receiving terminal in puerto rico ; and asset sales of offshore oil and gas properties in india . the approximately $ 2 . 9 billion portland general sale is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals . businesses under review these businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and gas wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets . while several of these businesses have very strong future prospects , we need to determine if their capital requirements and near - term growth prospects are sufficient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation . reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make reductions to our work force . more information will follow as soon as it becomes available . credit rating / 10 - q filing we continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our balance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating . our current credit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows : - - moody ' s at baa 3 "" under review for further downgrade "" - - fitch at bbb - "" evolving status "" - - s or investor relations , enron corp . , enron building , 1400 smith street , houston , tx 77002 , phone : ( 713 ) 853 - 3956 , fax : ( 713 ) 646 - 3302 . in addition , the identity of the persons who , under sec rules , may be considered "" participants in the solicitation "" of dynegy and enron shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions , and any description of their direct or indirect interests , by security holdings or otherwise , are available in an sec filing under schedule 14 a made by each of dynegy and enron ."	0

"" and anyone that does talk to any of you about that is breaking federal criminal law and should be in jail , "" rumsfeld said . when asked if he would lie to the press to disguise u . s . military operations , rumsfeld said "" you never say never . "" next phases of u . s . campaign more important to markets if us military action is limited to afghanistan , any immediate spike in oil prices is unlikely to endure because such a limited attack will not directly impact oil supply . however , us officials have said that the war on terrorism will go far beyond afghanistan , so markets will continue to exhibit some degree of uncertainty until further developments take place . in the short term , oil supplies would be most directly affected by strikes against iraq . but any spike might be short lived as opec has enough spare capacity to cover an iraqi outage . in the medium term , oil markets might express fears over regional stability in the middle east and persian gulf regions as a result of us military strikes and possible subsequent terrorist attacks . it is expected that iraqi biological - chemical weaponry will receive considerable attention in the days ahead and as has been widely reported , there is a split in the bush administration over whether to include iraq . the iraqi weapons of mass destruction capability is likely to once again complicate the rollover of the un oil - for - food program in december , which could lead to the iraqis removing their oil from the market independently of what is happening in afghanistan . another key issue is whether the expected refugee crisis and rising islamic radicalism will destabilize the nuclear - armed pakistani government . saudis showing increased cooperation in oil policy and in military planning after a brief furor when the saudi government announced that the u . s . would not be able to expand its operations at the prince sultan airbase near riyahd , us - saudi cooperation has improved . the public announcement of the airbase prohibition had been a pr move by the saudis to head off domestic accusations of handing blank checks to the usa . centcom has subsequently transferred its ops command to saudi arabia . in addition , the saudis have responded to u . s . pressure by officially severing relations with the taliban . in vienna , all indications are that the saudis are working toward an opec agreement to keep the market well supplied with oil and to not take advantage of the political uncertainty affecting the crude markets by cutting production . the most likely outcome is that opec will officially hold production at current levels , but agree to limited cheating to ensure adequate supply . another possibility is that opec will lower the target range for the opec basket price that would take lower demand forecasts into account . either step would allow opec to preserve cohesion at a time of political and economic uncertainty . if prices continue a rapid decline after the vienna meeting , washington and riyadh might come up with a "" politically correct "" way to "" spin "" an output reduction by blaming market volatility on speculators rather than on opec . the cartel is likely to reconvene in early november to reassess market conditions . fed shifts its model to adapt to new economic reality the fed is still struggling to answers for what recent events will do to the economy but it ' s clear that three elements of their model have fundamentally changed : 1 . the most important is a significant drop in all aspects of individuals ' and companies ' risk tolerance , which must be reversed quickly . the fed has done its bit by stabilizing the financial system and congress is stepping in with a total stimulus package of $ 100 - 150 billion ( greenspan supports $ 100 bln ) . on the diplomatic / military side , the balanced , multilateral approach of the administration together with discreet pressure on opec to reduce prices is all designed to stabilize expectations and boost sentiment . 2 . on rates , while the fed is expected to keep cutting ( they won ' t disappoint the market ) , sources report that greenspan is actually quite comfortable using liquidity to alter actual fed funds rather than changing official rates . however , the fed governors are increasingly convinced that sentiment really depends on military success and they are even more aware than that they are running out of ammunition on the rate cutting side . 3 . despite greenspan ' s protests we are looking at a fiscal boost that will push the budget to at least a 1 % of gdp deficit . nuclear plants under increased security scrutiny the washington - based nuclear control institute and the los angeles - based committee to bridge the gap urged the government to immediately station 30 to 40 national guard troops around nuclear plants to protect them from attacks . the watchdog groups also said the government should be prepared to deploy anti - aircraft weapons to shoot down attack planes . another needed measure is to carefully re - check the background of all nuclear plant employees and contractors to prevent internal sabotage ."	0

( nor has it explained the extensive use of star wars - related names by the related - party companies . ) it ' s not immediately clear what es power 3 is or does . so far , subpoenas issued by lawyers suing enron have determined the names of senior officers of es power 3 and its formation date , january 1999 . among es power 3 ' s senior executives are enron ceo ken lay , listed as a director , and mcmahon and fastow , listed as executive vice presidents . a raft of external directors are named as es power 3 directors , including comdisco ceo norman blake and ronnie chan , chairman of the hong kong - based hang lung group . a comdisco spokeswoman says blake isn ' t commenting on matters concerning enron and a call to the hang lung group wasn ' t immediately returned . demands , demands rating agencies moody ' s , fitch and s & p recently put enron ' s credit rating on review for a possible downgrade after an ljm deal that led to the $ 1 . 2 billion hit to equity . enron still has a rating three notches above investment grade . but its bonds trade with a yield generally seen on subinvestment grade , or junk , bonds , suggesting the market believes downgrades are likely . if enron ' s rating drops below investment grade , it must find cash or issue stock to pay off at least $ 3 . 4 billion in off - balance sheet obligations . in addition , many of its swap agreements contain provisions that demand immediate cash settlement if its rating goes below investment grade . friday , the company drew down $ 3 billion from credit lines to pay off commercial paper obligations . raising cash in the cp market could be tough when investors are jittery about enron ' s condition . this week , a number of energy market players reduced exposure to enron . however , in a friday press release , ceo lay said that enron was the "" market - maker of choice in wholesale gas and power markets .

"" we believe new money with high risk tolerance should wait until enron announces its intentions for communicating a clear path to recovery . "" dietert outlines four challenges for enron . one , management must regain the street ' s confidence and persuade investors that it can resolve balance - sheet strength and generate the expected earnings and cash flow . two , enron must maintain its investment - grade credit rating . three , enron must successfully execute its divestiture plans . four , enron must control the timing of the recognition of the write - down in the value of any assets where market value is less than book . straightforward ? yes . easy to accomplish ? no . although enron says additional write - downs are unlikely - - except a $ 200 million charge early next year as the result of an accounting change - - analysts aren ' t so sure . they ' re focused on the company ' s global assets portfolio , sporting $ 6 billion in book value but generating an ebit ( earnings before interest and taxes ) loss of $ 18 million over the past 12 months . the divestitures include $ 390 million in exploration and production assets in india , $ 250 million in a puerto rico power plant and $ 250 million in a brazilian power plant in the fourth quarter as well as the pending sale of portland general , which is set to close in 2002 . there will likely be others . however , enron has to execute here , and given the current state of its affairs , the seller will feel the pressure . the credit - rating issue is a fine line . the current ratings , bbb + from standard & poor ' s and baal from moody ' s , are three levels above non - investment grade . however , both rating agencies now have enron on their radar screens for possible downgrades . dietert estimates that enron ' s debt - to - market cap will be about 48 % by year - end , and the company has interest coverage ( ebitda / interest expense ) of about 3 . 5 times . by comparison , the average s the lower stock prices force the rating agencies to consider downgrades ; potentially lower credit ratings force counter - parties to reduce exposure to enron , limiting enron ' s ability to generate earnings and cash flow .

' s ( ene ) retail sales unit defaulted on its credit requirement in new england ' s wholesale power market this month , but the event was neither unique nor newsworthy , the energy company and the organization that developed the market ' s rules said friday . the operator of the region ' s wholesale power market informed enron energy services last week that , for the third time in 12 months , it had traded a greater volume of electricity than allowed by the bond it had posted and was at risk for expulsion from new england ' s market . but it was administrative mixups , rather than financial problems , that triggered the warning , which a few other companies have also received in the past , the market ' s rulemaker said . "" i can state with considerable confidence that there have been other participants "" that have defaulted on their credit agreements , "" and it ' s never been in the news , "" said david doot , secretary and general counsel for the new england power pool , which developed the policies governing the region ' s electricity market . "" my instinct is that this is blown way the hell out of proportion . "" news of the enron unit ' s default appeared in a trade publication and a major metropolitan newspaper this week , as enron ' s dealings with partnerships headed by its former chief financial officer contributed to a plunge in the company ' s stock and bond prices . enron energy services never received word that it had defaulted on its bonding requirement twice before , because both times it corrected the problem within a day , spokeswoman peggy mahoney said . the letter sent by iso new england , which operates the region ' s power market , to notify the enron unit of its third violation was addressed to the wrong person , delaying the company ' s response , mahoney said . "" clearly , it was an administrative error that we immediately took care of to ensure that we would never exceed the volume limit , "" mahoney said . the company resolved the problem by oct . 19 , mahoney said . iso new england spokeswoman ellen foley confirmed friday that the company had cured its default . it ' s rare for a company to default three times , but it has happened on occasion , foley and doot said . "" i won ' t say it ' s commonplace , but i won ' t say it ' s unusual for a participant to find itself out of compliance , "" doot said . "" those things have in fact happened from time to time .

gas pipelines . that allowed enron to move debt associated with those projects off its books . the affiliates bought the assets with borrowed money . they plan to repay the debt by eventually selling the assets . enron might be liable for any shortfall between the sales proceeds and the debt . that could amount to at least $ 3 . 3 billion if the assets don ' t generate any money , a remote possibility , the company has said . few answers investors and analysts pressed enron chief executive officer kenneth lay for details on the finances of the partnerships in a conference call tuesday . today , enron spokeswoman karen denne didn ' t respond to questions about one of them , es power 3 llc . texas records list 78 enron executives and employees as officers , directors and managers of es power 3 llc . the entire enron board is also listed . shares of enron $ 1 . 15 to $ 15 . 20 in late trading . -

- enron corp . , facing an inquiry by federal securities regulators into partnerships run by the former chief financial officer , remains a target of investigations and lawsuits in california . california lawmakers and regulators have accused power providers of manipulating the state ' s energy market to raise prices . enron , the biggest energy trader , and other power sellers have denied the charges repeatedly . next month , a california senate committee investigating the power market plans to hold a hearing to determine if enron and other generators are complying with subpoenas for trading documents . enron has been filing documents in sacramento , california . ` ` they are still putting documents in their depository , and i don ' t think they ' ve completed that process , ' ' said alexandra montgomery , a consultant to the committee . it ` ` remains to be seen ' ' whether enron is complying with its subpoena , she said . the suits and inquiries came after wholesale power prices in california soared , leaving the state ' s two largest utilities insolvent . under california ' s plan to open its electricity market to competition , the utilities of pg & e corp . and edison international weren ' t allowed to pass rising costs to customers . ` ` i know that we ' re doing our best to comply with what the committee is asking for , ' ' enron spokesman mark palmer . ` ` we are putting documents in the depository , and we ' re looking forward to a speedy resolution .

' ' ' lockyer later apologized for the remark . the attorney general ' s investigation is proceeding , lockyer spokeswoman sandra michioku said . michioku said she didn ' t know when civil or criminal charges against enron or other power providers might be filed . ` ` our investigation is still being pursued , ' ' she said . ` ` we had to go to court to get enron to turn over documents , so that slowed things down a bit .

' ' though enron ' s bonds have investment - grade ratings , their yield at current prices is higher than those of industrial bonds that carry junk ratings . according to bloomberg data , companies with ` ` bb ' ' ratings pay on average 9 . 16 percent to borrow for seven years . a lower credit rating may also force enron to buy back holdings in other partnerships with its stock , diluting the value of enron investors ' stock . partnerships called whitewing , marlin and yosemite own enron assets they bought with borrowed money . enron sold the assets to the partnerships to keep related debt off its books . the partnerships plan to repay the borrowed money by selling the assets . other liabilities if enron loses investment - grade rating , the borrowed money comes due earlier , leaving less time for the partnerships to find the best price for the power plants and other assets . enron would have to make up any shortfall between what the assets would sell for and the amount of the debt . one way would be issuing common shares to exchange for enron preferred convertible shares held by the partnerships . that would thin out the holdings of every other investor . of the two main bond - rating companies , moody ' s and fitch have enron on watch for possible downgrade , and standard & poor ' s lowered enron ' s long - term credit outlook to negative . egan - jones rating co . today lowered its rating on enron ' s debt to ` ` bb + , ' ' one notch below investment grade , from ` ` bbb - .

"Subject: california 02 / 16 / 01 pt . 2 our source reports the following regarding today ' s developments . in sum , due to the governor ' s sudden panic and resultant willingness to negotiate , all parties are in a wait - and - see mode that makes it unclear whether or not there will be an involuntary bankruptcy filing early next week . our consensus view is that bankruptcy is still the most likely outcome , but the timing is subject to the ups and downs of these negotiations over the weekend . creditors , especially the small ipps are close to the end on forbearance and highly frustrated with the erratic nature of the negotiations . the events given in this report are chronological : - the original plan proposed by governor davis to the utilities this morning contained the following points : the parent companies of the utilities would have to return to their subsidiaries $ 1 . 5 billion . this money was originally tranferred to the parent companies ostensibly so that the parents could use it to pay taxes . however , as was revealed in the audit , this money was in excess of what was needed for taxes in reality . the state would purchase the transmission assets for $ 3 . 5 billion . it was proposed that the utilities would issue bonds to pay for the utilities ' undercollection . these bonds would be secured against a "" distribution charge "" added to power bills . this money would be collected by dwr and transferred to the utilities , thereby involving the state , but with less than a "" full faith and credit "" commitment . - in contradiction to preliminary reports that appeared in the press , this plan was rejected by the utilities . one reason for this rejection was the low price on the transmission assets . - while the bondholders pressed for further negotiations at this point in order to see if a deal could be reached ; this is because the bondholders are less impaired than the generators . the generators , however , demanded that they be paid the money they are owed and threatened to move quickly toward an involuntary bankrtupcy filing . - local sources report that governor davis "" panicked "" at this point . he then offered to purchase the transmission assets for $ 6 billion ( almost twice the earlier offer ) and pay the generators ' undercollection ( which amounts to $ 9 to $ 12 billion ) . reportedly , the suggested term of the bonds that would be used to pay for this bail - out was 15 years , which would nearly double the actual cost of the bail - out . this plan would be put forward as a emergency legislative bill . - at this point , consumer advocate harvey rosenfield entered into negotiations with the state treasurer ' s office . rosenfield threatened that if the governor managed to pass this plan , he would start a referendum to counter it . rosenfield would have up to 90 days after the emergency bill was passed to put his referendum in place . knowledgeable sources advise that it would be "" very difficult "" for the bonds in the plan to be issued in less than 90 days ; therefore , rosenfield poses a credible threat . - in subsequent negotiations , governor davis has offered to purchase the transmission assets for a price of at least $ 6 billion , but possibly as high as $ 12 billion . - senator president pro tem john burton is ' very upset ' with the governor for giving in on his negotiations so easily . - mike florio , another consumer advocate , contacted gov . davis and said that the idea of negotiating a bail - out , as it appeared davis intended to do , was "" ridiculous . "" florio and the other consumer advocates threatened to ally themselves with rosenfield and support the referendum if davis pursued such a course of action . the consumer advocates strongly feel that the generators have to "" take a hair cut "" as part of the solution , as well . - the governor will announce later this afternoon a "" framework "" solution identical to that we have reported previously - a state purchase of transmission assets and an issuance of bonds by the utilities , but with state support through the dwr . however , the state government has yet to reach consensus on the numbers in this framework , and it remains unclear whether the framework will be acceptable to all parties . - with this announcement , the bondholders may refrain from an involuntary filing in order to see what the terms of the final agreement will be . the generators , while more inclined to file themselves , may feel that they have put enough pressure on the governor that it may be worthwhile to wait and see , as well . they are interested not only in the terms of the agreement ( and particularly the amount paid for the undercollect ) , but also in the terms of the long - term power contracts that the state must negotiate . for example , if the state is willing to purchase power at high prices in order to placate the generators , they would be very likely to go along with the plan . -"	0

( i am skipping ken lay , the ceo . ) charles lemaistre and john mendelsohn , two execs from the university of texas m . d . anderson cancer center , can ' t be expected to catch this stuff , and therefore gets a pass from me . paulo ferraz pereira is a former president and chief executive officer of the state bank of rio de janeiro . that ' s probably put him in more than his fair share of difficult financial situations . how could he not raise a word about it ? frank savage serves as chairman of alliance capital management international , perhaps the most sophisticated company in the world of money management . i am sure savage never saw a situation as bad as enron ' s looking through his own company ' s portfolio of investments . jeffrey skilling , the man who resigned as ceo , needs to be heard from . we know that he is a director of the houston branch of the federal reserve bank of dallas , a sinecure that slouches and undervigilant execs don ' t get hold . what did he know and when did he know it ? john wakeham , lord wakeham to everybody , is perhaps the most financially sophisticated brit to serve in parliament . he managed a large private practice as a chartered accountant . he ' s big and powerful and smart . herbert winokur is a longtime financial hand who also has run investment partnerships and used to serve as a director of penn central , a place that saw more than its share of ups and downs and tricky financial situations . in short , this is the most sophisticated , hands - on group of folks i have come across . i can ' t believe they checked off on this stuff . i have to believe they didn ' t know , or if they knew of the partnerships , i believe they had no idea what they were doing . i want so badly to presume that these partnerships were simply set up to take down a lot of debt and not hurt enron ' s credit rating with the agencies - - not that that ' s such an ethical setup . but at least it makes me think that the board might have been confused or not focused because it would have seemed unimportant , as they might not have known how big and how extended the partnerships were . still , let ' s not fool ourselves . this was a powerhouse , fantastic , upright board of people who know a thing or two . i can ' t believe they let this stuff occur . i think they knew nothing . which is pretty terrible in its own right . this market deserves your well - placed optimism by james j . cramer > realmoney . com 11 / 05 / 2001 10 : 32 am est url : > d ? j ? vu circa 1991 . that ' s what i keep thinking about . i recall that time vividly . bank of boston , chase , chemical , citibank , they all started rallying . we bears would call each other and joke about it . we would say that it was a ridiculous move , that it should be shorted and shorted aggressively , because there was no way that any of these banks would make it . heck , bank of boston was teetering on insolvency . citibank was technically bankrupt already . the jim grants of the world ( more powerful now than they were then because he didn ' t have as many years of being dead wrong but erudite under his belt ) would be alerting everyone to the absurdity of the common stocks of the banks rallying . i would call the analysts , and they wouldn ' t know anything either - - the ones who liked the banks all the way down , who still liked them and who had no credibility at all . the ones who hated them didn ' t want to get off the winning horses . they didn ' t know that the race was over and that a new one had begun . or , to put it the brutal way that i now know was right : no one with a brain was long any of these . turns out , of course , that brains were one of those commodities that was wildly overvalued at the bottom . what you had to do was check your skepticism and embrace optimism , because at certain points in history optimists get it right . that ' s how i feel about this market . i think the time to be skeptical was before all of the damage occurred . i think we will look back at this period and say the following : the great bear market started in march 2000 and was continuing to run rampant until sept . 11 , the crisis that triggered a massive influx of liquidity and lower interest rates that turned things around . most of the brains at the time were thinking that nothing really could change and that we were going to slide into a japanese recession or that no turn would ever come . they were wrong , just like they were in 1991 . we get so caught up in the "" is cisco bottoming ? "" or "" is intel breaking out ? "" minutiae that we forget that the market has been pretty good for some time now , pretty good since that crescendo selloff two months ago . you would think that we ' d have converted more bears to bulls by now , but like in 1991 , it didn ' t happen until well into the turn . don ' t confuse my optimism with some cold hard realities . i think that , for example , xo communications is going to fail , and when it does , there will be the requisite selloff and setbacks to tech . i think that mcleod is going to fail and we will see the same . there are a ton of companies that won ' t get through this period , just like there were a ton of banks and savings and loans that failed long after the turn came in 1991 . and i reserve the right to hate individual stocks . i can ' t get my arms around how ford comes back ; i don ' t understand the enron fiasco at all . i am not even sure that qwest can staunch the bleeding . but that doesn ' t make me bearish . understand that i am strictly a pavlovian creature . had i not lived through the giant financial short squeezes of late 1990 and early 1991 , had i not personally been "" bought in "" on a half - dozen banks i was shorting and had i not later on seen those banks get big bids from super - regionals not long after i , too , would be suspicious and want to bet against the market . i can ' t , though , because my capacity for loss remembrance is so much greater than my ability to remember my wins that the pattern stays in my head like a hot stove that i don ' t want to get burned by again . believe me , i am a cold - blooded individual about these things . if i thought the short side was the right side here , i would be all over it . we have had a huge bounce off the bottom ; there would be nothing "" unpatriotic "" about saying "" get out now .

Subject: california update 6 / 25 / 01 executive summary ? california budget resolved ? ferc ordered energy settlements stall mou / plan b budget california legislators in the house have once again established a tentative reserve amount for the state ' s depleted budget . both sides are reportedly uneasy with the $ 2 . 74 b compromise and sources indicate that the four republican votes needed to pass the budget in the assembly are likely far more obtainable than the one republican vote needed in the senate . california ' s current redistricting process may provide republicans with future seats that could translate into immediate bargaining power in energy and budget matters . adding to the frustration , sources indicate that consumer activist harvey rosenfield plans to pressure state treasurer angelides into battling with legislators for progress on the budget and revenue bonds . energy settlements today marked opening negotiations for california state energy officials and the several large energy providers who are charged with price gouging californians . sources close to california state sen . burton report that the results from thel 5 days of negotiations before the ferc appointed administrative law judge , curtis wagener , will significantly influence the state ' s efforts in promoting any plan b or mou . burton indicated that ferc would need to order between $ 3 and $ 4 b in generator refunds before the state would finalize a socal bail - out . of that amount , socal would most likely be infused with $ 1 b , however , without substantial contributions from power providers that sold into california and currently fall outside ferc ' s jurisdiction ( i . e . bc hydro & la dwp ) , a $ 3 to $ 5 b refund would be impossible to achieve . regardless of legislators ' desires , sources believe that consistent with the pg & e bankruptcy advisor ' s view , a multibillion dollar refund from ferc is unlikely . sources will continue to monitor and report on these negotiations .	0

conversion and integration test . each team will focus on both estate and new co . resources are too tight and the process is too inefficient to separate responsibility . 8 ) estate conversions must happen at the application level before new co conversion work can begin in earnest . estate conversion is on the critical path for new co . key issues 1 ) we will push to get a decision to see if we can focus on financial trading first , then physical . if financial is the focus , delivery risk goes down dramatically . for now , we must plan on the worst case - - physical and financial on jan 20 . 2 ) we need both a dev and a test environment for all systems that support aep and bridgeline in estate . this means that we need a dev environment ( and hw gap addressed ) for unify , sitara , cpr , tagg / erms . conversion teams need to coordinate with infrastructure immediately on this issue to make sure we ' re in synch . 3 ) unify servers probably can ' t be owned by new co while running a single license of unify . 4 ) some systems are using ' short name ' instead of duns id as a key for counterparties from global . the global , tagg / erms , unify and sap reps must quickly define the best approach for making global data changes and minimizing hard coded reference id risks . 5 ) we must clearly define limits of conversion and test scope to hit these potential dates . we must focus on core systems with only core changes required to support day one trading . 6 ) we can only convert estate over the weekend due to aep / bridgeline considerations . the time window will be very small . core conversion team 1 ) steve stock -

"" this is far from over , "" said one person familiar with the negotiations . several important points , including the exchange ratio , were still being worked out . dynegy expects to argue that enron shareholders will benefit from the upside of combining the two companies and that a transaction will add to dynegy ' s earnings because of potential synergies . spokesmen from enron and dynegy declined to comment . if approved by regulators , the deal would be a stunning development for enron , which transformed itself from a staid natural - gas - pipeline company into a highflying power - trading giant only to see its share price - - and hefty market valuation - - plummet in a matter of weeks . and for enron to sell itself for a low price is sure to stun investors . under the terms being worked out last night , enron chairman kenneth lay would have a seat on the combined company ' s board , but wouldn ' t hold any formal management position , said the people familiar with the matter . mr . lay may take on a consulting role . meanwhile , chuck watson , chairman and chief executive of dynegy , would be ceo of the combined company , while his no . 2 , stephen bergstrom , will president . enron has been scrambling for days to line up quick financing from a prominent outside investor and has been in discussions with private - equity firms and power - trading companies . the company desperately needs to win back its credibility on wall street following the disclosure that the securities and exchange commission was investigating the partnerships created to serve as a hedge against fluctuating market conditions . discussions between dynegy and enron began about 10 days ago , but intensified last weekend . enron also is expected today to disclose more financial dealings about the partnerships . a person close to dynegy said the potential acquirer feels it understands enron ' s business and is apprised of the liabilities , which have been factored into the transaction . should enron strike a deal , it hopes to stabilize its stock price . enron fell 6 . 4 % , or 62 cents , to $ 9 . 05 at 4 p . m . composite trading on the new york stock exchange . at one point yesterday morning , enron ' s stock had fallen 25 % on news reports that enron ' s efforts to line up investors had failed . the stock recovered after cnbc and dow jones newswires reported the talks with dynegy . the shares are at a new 52 - week low and far from the 52 - week high of $ 84 . 88 . dynegy fell $ 3 , or 8 . 3 % , to $ 33 , at 4 p . m . in big board trading . however , some investors believed the company ' s share price could benefit from the deal . jason selch , an energy analyst at wanger asset management in chicago , a large dynegy shareholder , said the company has a history of pulling off complicated deals and added that because enron is in such bad shape , dynegy could dictate the terms of the deal , shielding itself from potential losses due to shareholder lawsuits or problems with enron ' s complicated off - balance sheet dealings . "" if they make an offer , they will be making an offer in order to get a steal , "" said mr . selch , who says enron ' s core energy - trading business is being valued at about half the normal market valuation of these operations . "" i think they will be acquiring a business that will launch them into the no . 1 market - share position in energy trading , "" mr . selch added . whether a deal with dynegy materializes , the fact that enron is willing to consider a sale shows how its fortunes have sagged and underscores how desperate it is for a savior . the company , which was at the pinnacle of its success just a year earlier , boasted a market capitalization of $ 71 billion about a year ago and is now valued at about $ 7 billion . in exchange for the immediate capital infusion , dynegy is expected to get convertible preferred stock . in that type of deal , an investor receives a safe , bondlike interest payment and then can convert that holding into common stock after the share price rises to a specified level . enron also had been soliciting interest from private equity firms , but any discussions with those parties were proceeding on a slower track . people familiar with the negotiations said it was possible the financial players could still play some sort of role in any enron transaction , although details weren ' t immediately available . buyout firms clayton , dubilier & rice and blackstone group , which had been approached by enron to make an investment , decided against doing so , according to people familiar with the matter . indeed , enron ' s move to publicly disclose new information about the partnerships could provide intriguing details to any other potential bidders who are interested in a deal , but were reluctant to pursue enron without knowing more about those transactions . and because dynegy may only be paying a small premium , another suitor may be able to step up to the plate . the deal , if agreed to , will add to dynegy ' s earnings in the first year . the new entity will focus on the core business of north american and european wholesale , commercial and industrial energy markets and will capitalize on the opportunities generated by the combined , diversified asset - backed network supported by the strongest intellectual capital in the industry . aside from restoring confidence among its investors , enron has faced growing pressure from its trading partners . the company is offering special protections to some trading partners , hoping to prevent a mass exodus due to fears it could face further credit downgrades or wind up seeking the protection of a federal bankruptcy court . the protection takes the form of a "" netting agreement "" that permits a trading partner to offset the sums it is owed by various enron entities against the amounts that it owes the enron concerns . without such an arrangement , a company might owe money to one enron entity but have to stand in a long , slow line to collect sums owed by a different enron concern should the company seek bankruptcy - court protection . with netting , positions could cancel each other out , at least to some extent , and reduce a firm ' s ultimate credit exposure . enron spokesman mark palmer said the company has plenty of cash and has no need or intention of seeking protection from creditors , with whom it is current . - - - jathon sapsford , robert frank and ken brown contributed to this article . copyright ? 2000 dow jones section c dynegy is said to be near to acquiring enron for $ 8 billion by richard a . oppel jr . and andrew ross sorkin 11 / 08 / 2001 the new york times page 1 , column 2 c . 2001 new york times company the board of dynegy inc . tentatively approved a deal last night to acquire the enron corporation , the once - mighty energy - trading company laid low by a financial crisis and government investigation , executives close to the transaction said . a deal would enable dynegy to buy the much bigger enron at a fire - sale price - - about $ 8 billion in stock , or roughly $ 10 a share , for a company that less than a year ago had a market value of nearly $ 70 billion . but with stock and bond investors fleeing , some of its trading partners refusing to do business with it , enron had few choices but to talk to dynegy . as part of the deal , chevron texaco , which owns a 27 percent stake in dynegy , would give enron a cash infusion of at least $ 1 . 5 billion up front and an additional $ 1 billion when the deal closed . the executives said the companies hope to finalize the details and announce the deal today . if completed , a takeover by dynegy , a company only about one - quarter its size in revenue , would represent a remarkable humbling of enron , the nation ' s biggest buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity . enron had $ 139 . 7 billion in revenue for the first nine months of the year . as recently as last spring enron was lionized by investors as an innovator that had in many ways created and cleverly dominated the nation ' s deregulated energy markets . it would also vindicate not only dynegy , which took a more measured approach to doing business in those markets , but also critics uncomfortable with energy deregulation who said enron ' s energy trading was ruthless , its finances murky and its power and influence too extensive . the company ' s chairman and chief executive , kenneth l . lay , is a close friend of president bush . he has been one of mr . bush ' s largest campaign contributors , and no other energy company gave more money to republican causes last year than enron . mr . lay would be on the board of the combined companies , the executives said , but it was unclear if he would have an operational role . enron ' s problems came to light last month when the company disclosed $ 1 billion in write - downs and an unusual $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity . the reduction in equity arose from transactions with investment partnerships involving andrew fastow , the chief financial officer , who was forced to resign on oct . 24 . the securities and exchange commission is investigating those transactions . enron is expected today to send the s . e . c . answers to questions the agency has posed in its investigation . the answers have been reviewed by dynegy officials , the executives said , and are expected to be released publicly . enron is scheduled to meet its creditors tomorrow about the company ' s continuing crisis - - and about the merger deal , if there is one . people close to the deal say the company hopes that a deal with dynegy , and the release of the answers to the s . e . c . , will calm the crisis that has engulfed the company and led other energy companies that trade with enron to curtail their credit exposure to the company . besides worries about the huge losses and the s . e . c . investigation , investors and creditors are nervously watching enron ' s credit rating . moody ' s investors service and standard and poor ' s have already cut the rating to two notches above junk status , and on monday , fitch inc . cut it to one notch above junk . as part of the acquisition , dynegy would be taking on enron ' s $ 12 . 8 billion debt load - - a number that does not include billions of dollars of other debt , accumulated off the balance sheet , that has played a major role in enron ' s current problems . the executives said they expected the deal would lead to the sale of some enron assets to pay down the $ 12 . 8 billion debt . should enron lose its investment grade rating , other energy trading companies could curtail their business with the company even further , and enron could be forced to issue tens of millions of shares of stock to cover off - balance sheet debts that it has guaranteed . early wednesday , shares of enron plunged 28 percent , to about $ 7 , on fears that the company was unable to line up new investors . but the stock took back most of its losses in the afternoon after cnbc reported the talks with dynegy . shares of enron closed at $ 9 . 05 , off 62 cents . dynegy shares closed at $ 33 , down $ 3 . in addition to both companies ' very large presence in energy trading , enron owns the portland general electric company , a utility in oregon it had already agreed to sell , and dynegy owns the illinova corporation , a retail electricity and natural gas utility in illinois . regulators may take a hard look at those utilities in reviewing a merger deal , said jeff dietert , an analyst with simmons & company in houston . ' ' then you ' ve got concerns about market power , ' ' he said . ' ' it ' s just a lot of different issues to deal with before we get too excited that this deal is going to get done . ' ' the acquisition would combine enron , which dominates united states trading of electricity and natural gas and has been shedding its hard assets , with dynegy , a company that has pursued a much different strategy of using trading to maximize earnings from its power plants . enron has always concentrated on sophisticated financial trading strategies , a senior executive at a rival energy - trading firm , said .

"" a lot of hype . a lot of spin , "" recalls todd shipman , a standard & poor ' s analyst who attended the conference . "" that was enron . "" yesterday , enron stock closed at $ 9 . 05 in new york stock exchange trading . mr . skilling is no longer around to promote the stock . in august , he unexpectedly resigned as chief executive after only six months in the top job . chief financial officer andrew fastow was replaced last month as controversy escalated over his role in running private partnerships involved in billions of dollars of transactions with enron . kenneth lay , enron ' s chief executive , has had to give up retirement plans to return to the helm . lately , the company has been offering special credit protection to increasingly nervous trading partners , including reliant energy inc . and entergy corp . the goal : to provide assurance that enron is a creditworthy partner and to prevent an exodus of customers . enron ' s trading operation generates 90 % of the company ' s profits . it looked yesterday as if the endgame might be beginning . mr . lay and enron ' s board were discussing a possible acquisition of enron by its much - smaller hometown energy - trading rival , dynegy inc . , in a stock swap valued at $ 7 billion to $ 8 billion . ( see related article on page a 3 . ) any merger of the two companies would probably face lengthy regulatory scrutiny , so dynegy is also considering injecting $ 1 . 5 billion into enron immediately to help stabilize the company ' s finances , according to people familiar with the situation . the deal would also include a significant role for oil powerhouse chevrontexaco , which owns a 26 % stake in dynegy and would be likely to provide much of the cash for any enron transaction . dynegy ' s emergence as a serious bidder for enron could indicate to other interested parties that enron ' s problems can be solved . in fact , the collapse in enron ' s stock price would make it fairly easy for another large energy player to top any dynegy offer . royal dutch / shell group is one such prominent company . a takeover by dynegy or any other company would almost certainly presage the departure of the 59 - year - old mr . lay . he oversaw the transformation of enron from a nondescript natural - gas pipeline company with annual revenue of under $ 5 billion in the late 1980 s to a global energy colossus with revenue that is expected to approach $ 200 billion this year . it has turned out that the formula behind that transformation contained the seeds for the company ' s current troubles . executives created an ever - more - labyrinthine financial structure to support enron ' s explosive growth rate . billions of dollars of debt - - which could have weakened enron ' s credit rating and slowed growth - - was kept off the balance sheet through tangled webs of transactions with dozens of related entities . as the financial demands became greater and the transactions more complex , enron officials began creating and heading some of the entities , raising serious conflict - of - interest questions . neither enron nor dynegy would comment . royal dutch / shell also declined to comment . messrs . lay , skilling and fastow either declined to comment or didn ' t return phone calls seeking interviews . enron officials have maintained that the markets are overreacting to a spate of bad , but nonfatal , news . on oct . 16 , the company announced a $ 618 million third - quarter loss and disclosed a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction of shareholder equity due in part to dealings with the fastow - related partnerships . the company has said that its ongoing businesses are strong and it has the financial wherewithal to weather the crisis . all of its actions have been legal and properly disclosed , enron has stressed . still , its predicament is daunting . the securities and exchange commission has started a formal investigation into possible violations of federal securities law involving the fastow - related partnerships . several shareholder lawsuits seeking class - action status have been filed against top company officials , alleging fraud and seeking to recover some of the $ 20 billion in market value that enron shares have lost in the past month . to address growing jitters in the energy and financial markets , enron has drawn down billions of dollars of credit lines , negotiated new ones and sought a new equity infusion . as turmoil has engulfed the company , mr . lay and other top enron executives have kept largely out of public view - - in sharp contrast to the company ' s normally outspoken public persona . the one recent public - relations initiative , a conference call for analysts and big investors , turned into what even enron officials concede privately was a debacle . it left company executives looking evasive and defensive rather than open and confident . how did enron , which routinely made published lists of the most - admired and innovative companies in america , fly so high and fall so fast ? the answer lies in a combination of brilliance and overconfidence on a scale rarely seen in the business world . in the process , the company helped redefine much of the energy marketplace on matters as fundamental as how power is bought and sold and how a company produces a profit from doing so . for example , the company helped create an electricity - trading market in which participants rarely take physical delivery of the commodity but instead merely tally profits or losses from transactions . in the accounting realm , it pioneered techniques that allowed energy companies to record profits or losses on long - term contracts that hadn ' t yet produced any revenue . "" we caught a little flak in the early 1990 s from people who , i guess , thought we were pulling a fast one , "" enron ' s chief accounting officer , richard causey , said in an interview in august . he added that this accounting method was the most accurate way to measure energy - trading results . enron ' s audacity and success sent other energy companies scrambling to emulate it , a process that abn amro analyst paul patterson calls "" enron envy . "" the company tested the limits of securities and accounting rules . for example , enron ' s sec filings have included statements about the fastow - related transactions that might meet the letter of disclosure laws but are so complex that even some wall street analysts and accounting professors have found them indecipherable . enron ' s seemingly impenetrable financial structure , hardly noticed by wall street in the company ' s heyday , is now a matter of serious concern in a suddenly skeptical investment community . "" it ' s not easy to regain something as basic as trust , "" says goldman sachs analyst david fleischer , a longtime enron fan . in the recent conference call with enron executives , mr . fleischer pleaded with the company to be more forthcoming about its operations - - something it has been promising to do for months . while enron employs some 20 , 000 people , its rise and fall can , in large measure , be traced to three men : messrs . lay , skilling and fastow . mr . lay joined the company in 1984 when it was still called houston natural gas , a regional pipeline operator . back then , the natural - gas industry was a largely regional business and about as exciting as watching a pipeline operate . but mr . lay had big plans for his company , always preaching that natural gas was the fuel of the future . his prediction has been largely borne out when it comes to such functions as fueling electric - power plants . he wanted to take the company beyond natural gas . enron bought an electric utility in portland , ore . , and built power plants around the world . it developed its potent energy - trading operation , which buys and sells contracts to provide electricity in the same way that contracts for wheat and pork bellies are traded . these deals were done with utilities , industrial power users and other trading firms . to help enlarge this empire , he recruited aggressive young executives . none was brighter or more assertive than mr . skilling , a harvard business school graduate and former mckinsey & co . consultant who joined enron in 1990 . under messrs . lay and skilling , the company pushed zealously for the deregulation of energy markets - - particularly that bastion of monopoly businesses , the electric - utility industry . enron officials argued that open , competitive markets could help consumers and , not coincidentally , provide huge profit opportunities in energy trading . mr . skilling called the energy - trading business "" a once - in - a - lifetime opportunity to establish a position to last for the next 100 years . "" by the late 1990 s , enron had evolved into primarily a trading company , rather than an owner of power plants and pipelines . in pursuit of their deregulation goals , enron officials became major players in american politics . mr . lay has given nearly $ 2 million to president bush during his political career and is a personal friend of the president , vice president cheney and several members of the cabinet . one of mr . skilling ' s early hires after joining enron was mr . fastow , at the time a 29 - year - old mba from northwestern ' s kellogg school who had been working on leveraged buyouts and other complicated deals at continental bank in chicago . former enron officials and others say that mr . skilling quickly became mr . fastow ' s mentor in the same way that mr . lay had become mr . skilling ' s . as mr . skilling oversaw the building of enron ' s vast trading operation , mr . fastow saw to the financing of it . "" andy was the guy you saw when you wanted money "" for a project , says one former enron senior manager . mr . skilling was named enron ' s chief operating officer in 1997 . mr . fastow got the top finance job a year later , at the age of 36 . under mr . fastow , enron ' s finance department tripled in size , to more than 100 people . enron needed the added financial brainpower . as it expanded , debt and liquidity were constant concerns . what ' s more , the company ' s ambitions were roving beyond therms and kilowatts as it began to make markets in everything from water to weather . enron ' s most highly touted non - energy initiative , and mr . skilling ' s pet project , came in the area of telecommunications . the company built a coast - to - coast fiber - optic network and envisioned trading "" bandwidth , "" or network capacity , the way it traded electricity or natural gas . enron has invested several hundred million dollars so far in the project , which has produced losses of over $ 400 million . yet at the february analyst meeting in houston , mr . skilling unabashedly valued enron ' s fiber - optic business at $ 36 billion , according to people who were at the meeting . but to make all of its growth dreams possible , enron had to make sure that its balance sheet didn ' t become too laden with debt . too much debt would lead major ratings agencies , such as moody ' s investors service and standard & poor ' s , to lower enron ' s credit rating . such downgrades could significantly increase the company ' s cost of borrowing and make it more difficult to finance its continued expansion . in typically aggressive fashion , enron lobbied the ratings agencies with the same vigor that it lobbied legislators . at the february meeting , mr . fastow urged analysts to raise enron ' s credit rating on long - term debt from triple - b - plus to single - a - minus . but the analysts shrugged off mr . fastow ' s entreaties . they didn ' t see the cash flow , earnings , or debt coverage required for such an upgrade , says one attendee . undeterred , mr . fastow said the higher rating would strengthen the company ' s basic finances , which could then justify the higher rating . this circular argument provoked derision among analysts , and enron didn ' t get its ` a ' rating . instead , the company was recently downgraded by the major ratings agencies as a result of its financial turmoil . in moves that kept down its reported debt burden , enron turned increasingly to off - balance - sheet transactions through limited partnerships with outside parties . in such an arrangement , enron could contribute money , stock or other assets to the partnership . the partnership could then borrow large sums to purchase assets or do business deals without the debt showing up on enron ' s books . while such partnership transactions had long been used in the natural - gas industry to finance deals , enron took the practice to new heights of complexity . leading that effort was mr . fastow and his team of young financial experts . in recent years , enron has done myriad deals with more than 30 partnerships . by far the most controversial to come to light , so far , are the ones it has done with two partnerships - - known as ljm cayman lp and ljm 2 co - investment lp - - which were formed and operated by mr . fastow . the company has said that its transactions with these partnerships were designed to hedge against fluctuating market values of company assets and energy contracts . it isn ' t clear why enron would allow its chief financial officer to be in a fiduciary position at partnerships that stood to profit , possibly at the company ' s expense , from doing deals with it . to make matters worse , private ljm partnership documents indicate that mr . fastow personally made millions of dollars from the partnerships - - much more than he was being paid as enron ' s chief financial officer . enron officials have repeatedly said that mr . fastow ' s actions were reviewed and approved by top management and the board of directors . however , the company has refused to answer numerous specific questions about its dealings with the partnerships . enron has said that mr . fastow formally severed his ties with the partnerships in july in the face of rising discomfort about the arrangements on the part of analysts and major company investors . it is nearly impossible to stitch together anything comprehensible about the partnership deals from enron ' s sec filings . the only thing clear is that millions of shares of enron stock and billions of dollars of assets and notes were involved in the transactions . - - - robin sidel and jathon sapsford contributed to this article . copyright ?

"" we transformed finance into a merchant organization , one engaged in the intermediation of both commodity and capital risk positions , "" fastow told cfo magazine in 1999 . "" essentially , we would buy and sell risk positions . "" the company also needed to raise more cash but couldn ' t issue equity , which would dilute shareholders ' value , or issue more debt , a threat to its credit rating . fastow ' s solution was to make it clear to the rating agencies that he was serious about keeping the good ratings by generating fast - growing cash flow , even though the company would issue more stock . a roadshow for analysts was organized to outline the plan and demonstrate the finance team ' s skills at maintaining the high - wire act . the sales pitch worked . when enron issued 17 . 2 million shares in an offering and raised about $ 800 million , rating agencies liked it and share values didn ' t drop . the second part of the plan involved selling off nonstrategic assets , such as pipelines and other business units , to create even more cash flow . that cash was reinvested . under this new , more aggressive strategy , enron grew in different ways . for example , in october 1998 the company acquired three new jersey power plants from cogen technologies by going to the capital markets to issue about $ 1 . 5 billion in equity and debt . enron kept that capital off its own balance sheets by creating a special - purpose entity to which it sold a 50 percent interest in the plants . another deal involved enron ' s $ 2 . 3 billion purchase of wessex water , a british water company , in 1998 . enron created a special off - balance - sheet partnership named atlantic water trust and issued $ 1 . 3 billion in enron shares into it . the trust then went to the capital markets to raise $ 1 billion in debt that was backed by those shares . the trust purchased wessex , and because enron owned no more than 50 percent of wessex , it didn ' t experience earnings dilution and didn ' t have that $ 1 billion in debt counted on its books . these complex deals won fastow and his team praise and industry awards . so what went wrong ? while many of enron ' s off - balance - sheet deals worked with little controversy , the accounting innovation eventually worked against the company . details on the more complicated deals , particularly the partnerships named ljm cayman and ljm 2 co - investment , which left the company with a $ 1 billion charge last quarter , have been hard to come by so far . but they appear to have been used to hedge against the risk of some of the company ' s newer lines of business beyond its core . "" power plants in india , water companies , extension of their franchise to the mass retail market and using a fiber optic network to deliver content over the internet are all unrelated or only tangentially related to their core merchant energy business , "" said ray niles , an analyst with salomon smith barney . "" all of the write - offs appear to be in these noncore , nonenergy merchant areas . "" the off - balance - sheet partnerships also went on to buy the stock of other companies , said john olson , an analyst with sanders morris harris . "" they own pieces of a variety of companies they ' ve done asset trades with , oil - services companies , producers , "" olson said . "" and many of those shares are underwater right now . "" the partnerships also appear to have invested in options to buy shares of enron at a fixed price with plans to make money by later selling them at a higher price . "" it was perfectly sound logic when their stock was going up , but when it started to go down , it came as quite a shock , "" olson said . while the details of enron ' s partnerships remain elusive for the time being , there ' s little doubt that unraveling their true nature will be difficult for even the keenest financial and legal minds .

( cvx ) , which owns a 26 % stake in dynegy , is expected to provide dynegy with the funds for the cash infusion and is playing a significant role in the negotiations . chevrontexaco then will inject another $ 1 billion into the combined company once the deal is concluded so that its stake in dynegy isn ' t substantially reduced . under the terms being worked out wednesday night , enron chairman kenneth lay would have a seat on the combined company ' s board , but wouldn ' t hold any formal management position , said the people familiar with the matter . mr . lay may take on a consulting role . the boards of dynegy , chevron and enron were meeting wednesday to discuss a potential deal , but a seesawing enron stock price and the complexity of a transaction yet could derail a deal , people familiar with the matter warned . several important points , including the exchange ratio , were still being worked out , but dynegy is expected to pay a very modest premium for enron ' s stock , arguing that enron shareholders will benefit from the upside of combining the two companies . enron also is expected thursday to disclose more financial dealings about the controversial partnerships . spokesmen from enron and dynegy declined to comment . if approved by regulators , the deal would be a stunning development for enron , which transformed itself from a staid natural - gas - pipeline company into a highflying power trading giant only to see its share price - - and hefty market valuation - - plummet in a matter of weeks . enron has been scrambling for days to line up quick financing from a prominent outside investor and has been in discussions with private - equity firms and power - trading companies . the company desperately needs to win back its credibility on wall street following the disclosure that the securities and exchange commission was investigating the partnerships created to serve as a hedge against fluctuating market conditions . discussions between dynegy and enron began about 10 days ago , but intensified last weekend . should enron strike a deal , it hopes to stabilize its stock price . enron fell 6 . 4 % , or 62 cents , to $ 9 . 05 at 4 p . m . composite trading on the new york stock exchange . at one point wednesday morning , enron ' s stock had fallen 25 % on news reports that enron ' s efforts to line up investors had failed . the stock recovered after cnbc and dow jones newswires reported the talks with dynegy . the shares are at a new 52 - week low and far from the 52 - week high of $ 84 . 88 . dynegy fell $ 3 , or 8 . 3 % , to $ 33 , at 4 p . m . in big board trading . however , some investors believed the company ' s share price could benefit from the deal . copyright ( c ) 2001 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . dynegy reportedly close to deal to buy enron for $ 8 billion 11 / 07 / 2001 associated press newswires copyright 2001 . the associated press . all rights reserved . houston ( ap ) - dynegy inc . was reportedly in the late stages of discussions wednesday night with rival enron corp . to buy the embattled energy - trading company for about $ 8 billion in stock , or roughly $ 10 per share . under the terms of the deal , enron would receive an immediate $ 1 . 5 billion cash infusion from oil giant chevron texaco , which holds a 27 percent stake in dynegy , the new york times reported on its web site , citing executives close to the discussion . chevron texaco would provide an additional $ 1 billion injection at a later date , the times reported , while dynegy would assume $ 12 . 8 billion in enron debt , plus billions of dollars in other debt that has been kept off the beleaguered company ' s balance sheet and has been a significant contributor to its current problems . enron chairman kenneth lay would not be given any formal management position in the combined company , although he would have a seat on its board , the wall street journal reported , citing people familiar with the matter . the boards of both companies were meeting late wednesday and could announce the deal as early as thursday , although the journal reported that the transaction could still be derailed . enron did not return calls seeking comment . dynegy spokesman steve stengel said the company would not respond to "" rumor and speculation . "" in wednesday trading , dynegy ' s shares were down $ 3 to close at $ 33 on the new york stock exchange , while enron ' s stock was off 62 cents and closed at $ 9 . 05 . shares of chevrontexaco rose 48 cents to $ 87 . 28 on the nyse . enron ' s stock is off more than 79 percent since oct . 16 , when the company said shareholder equity had been reduced by $ 1 . 2 billion , in part due to partnerships managed by enron ' s former chief financial officer , andrew fastow . at the same time , enron reported a $ 618 million third quarter loss last month , dragged down by a one - time charge of $ 1 . 01 billion attributed to various losses . fastow was ousted a week later . the company ' s financial stability was further weakened after the securities and exchange commission began an inquiry , which was upgraded to a formal investigation , of the partnerships and possible conflicts of interest resulting from them . jeff skilling , enron ' s former chief executive , has been called to testify before the sec , although it remains unclear when that will occur , said denis calabrese , a spokesman for skilling . enron ' s woes have prompted considerable speculation about a possible takeover of the company . before wednesday , companies mentioned as possible suitors included general electric ' s ge capital unit and royal dutch / shell group . duane grubert , an analyst with sanford c . bernstein and co . , said a merger between enron and dynegy makes sense . "" i think dynegy could be a very good fit in terms of understanding the merchant business , having a similar culture , "" grubert said . "" enron was initially proactive at teaming up with non - competitors but once it exhausted that route "" it went in another direction . in the past few weeks , enron has cashed in about $ 3 billion in revolving credit it has with various banks to shore up investor confidence . last week , enron secured $ 1 billion in new financing , using some of its natural gas and pipeline assets as collateral . meanwhile , standard & poor ' s corp . on wednesday lowered its ratings on some of enron ' s credit linked notes and placed them on creditwatch . s & p said enron ' s plan to repair its damaged balance sheet through asset sales and other means will be insufficient . moody ' s investors service and fitch inc . have also downgraded the company ' s credit ratings . last week , enron announced it created a special committee headed by university of texas law school dean william powers to respond to the sec investigation . - - - on the net : http : / / www . dynegy . com http : / / www . enron . com copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . usa : wrapup 2 - enron , dynegy in merger talks . by andrew kelly 11 / 07 / 2001 reuters english news service ( c ) reuters limited 2001 . houston , nov 7 ( reuters ) - dynegy inc . is in talks to buy troubled enron corp . in a deal that would involve a stock swap and a $ 1 . 5 billion capital infusion from chevrontexaco , which has a big stake in dynegy , a source close to the talks said on wednesday . the deal , which could be announced officially this week , was expected to give what the source called a "" modest premium "" to enron shareholders , whose stock has plummeted in value as a fast - moving financial crisis enveloped the company . for dynegy , the merger would catapult it to the top of the energy trading industry now dominated by enron . last year , the company had $ 29 billion in revenues , compared to $ 100 billion for enron . for enron , it would cap an astonishingly rapid fall from grace for a company that not long ago was ballyhooed as one of the world ' s most innovative , not to mention profitable . the source said the form of chevrontexaco ' s capital infusion was not yet clear . chevron , which recently merged with texaco , was one of dynegy ' s founding investors and still owns 26 . 5 percent of the company . stock hammered enron has seen its stock hammered and credit ratings lowered in recent weeks after reporting its first quarterly loss in four years and taking a $ 1 . 2 billion equity writedown linked to financial transactions under investigation by the u . s . securities and exchange commission . enron shares , which traded as high as $ 90 in august of last year , dropped to a 10 - year - low of $ 7 during wednesday ' s trading session before rallying on news of the dynegy talks . the stock ended down 62 cents at $ 9 . 05 on volume of 72 . 4 million shares , the day ' s most active issue on the new york stock exchange . dynegy stock fell $ 3 to $ 33 . enron , the nation ' s largest trader of natural gas and electricity , has been under fire for failing to explain off - balance sheet transactions conducted with partnerships run by ousted chief financial officer andrew fastow . investors said they reeked of conflict of interest and demanded a full explanation they never got . fastow left the company last month in what has become a growing line of high - profile departures from enron , topped by the august resignation of chief executive jeff skilling after just six months on the job . the crisis has undermined confidence in enron ' s financial stability , which in turn has forced the company to seek cash and credit to back the energy trading operations that provide most of its revenue and earnings . the new york times said on wednesday enron had approached at least a dozen buyout firms and investor warren buffett , chairman of berkshire hathaway inc . . , but none took the bait . analysts have said would - be investors are wary because no one knows what financial liabilities , if any , lurk in enron ' s labyrinthine books . firesale but andre meade of commerzbank securities said the firesale price for enron apparently was too attractive to pass up . "" certainly , enron at $ 9 a share appeals to some energy companies . dynegy appears to be one of them and is looking at putting something together , "" he said . in contrast to dynegy , rival el paso corp . said on wednesday it wanted no part of enron , except perhaps for a few hard assets . el paso also said enron was perhaps neither as big or important to markets as analysts believe . "" if enron goes away , which we don ' t think is going to happen and we hope it doesn ' t happen , we don ' t see the market missing a beat , frankly , "" ralph eads , head of el paso ' s merchant energy business , told a meeting of analysts . eads said el paso calculates that enron accounts for about 10 percent of trading in u . s . wholesale gas and power , well below the 25 percent usually attributed to them by analysts . at least one company , apache corp . , said it ended some hedging agreements because of concerns about increasing risk in the energy derivatives market caused by the enron crisis . pat wood , chairman of the federal energy regulatory commission , told reporters the agency was keeping an eye on the markets , watching for an enron effect . "" we ' re watching the impact that enron or any other firm would have on the overall workings of the market , but we ' re not intervening where other agencies have jurisdiction , "" he said . copyright ? 2000 dow jones bloomberg says chevron , which has a 27 % stake in dynegy , will add $ 1 . 5 billion to the deal . the deal is expected to be a stock swap at a small premium to enron ' s wednesday closing price of $ 9 . 05 . enron was off 7 cents in after - hours trading while dynegy was up 34 cents , to $ 33 . 34 . a merger would amount to a rescue of houston energy - trading giant enron , whose stock has plunged nearly 90 % in recent weeks after the company revealed that a shadowy deal caused a $ 1 . 2 billion hit to equity . the controversial deal is under investigation by the securities and exchange commission and has led to the ousting of the company ' s cfo , andrew fastow . the deluge of bad news has prompted other energy companies to reduce their dealings with enron , a serious development for a trading company . dynegy ' s board was meeting wednesday afternoon to discuss the merger , while enron ' s board was scheduled to consider the combination wednesday evening . a dynegy spokesman declined to comment , citing a company policy of not commenting on market rumors . enron spokespersons did not return calls . chevron declined to comment . chevron ' s involvement appears critical if the deal is to gain the approval of rating agencies . dynegy ' s balance sheet is not strong enough to acquire enron on its own . therefore , chevron is expected to raise its stake in dynegy and possibly make an immediate cash infusion into enron . the size of any infusions will be a good indication of how bad things have gotten at enron . with the stock plummeting and enron facing a mounting debt crisis - - $ 12 billion in direct debt and nearly $ 9 billion in potential liabilities from affiliates - - the company is running out of options . it recently drew down about $ 3 billion in existing credit lines and gained an additional $ 1 billion in credit secured by its pipeline business . enron debt has been downgraded in recent days by the three main credit - rating agencies . sources say a number of potential investors have been approached - - from warren buffett ' s berkshire hathaway ( brka : nyse - news - commentary ) to royal dutch / shell ( rd : nyse adr - news - commentary ) - - with little success . ? ? general electric ' s ( ge : nyse - news - commentary ) capital division is said to have held multiple talks with enron with no resolution . ? dynegy may be motivated by its significant exposure to enron . if enron had failed , dynegy could have faced serious disruption and large losses because the two firms are trading partners on a number of contracts . in such a relationship , dynegy could have contracts to purchase a commodity like power or natural gas from enron and be committed to sell that commodity to another buyer . if enron failed to deliver , the domino effect could have a significant economic impact on dynegy . while other energy trading firms have exposure , sources speculate dynegy ' s exposure is more significant than its peers . ? enron was down as much as 20 % during the day . dynegy stock was off 8 % in the regular session , while its bonds also skidded on rumors of a deal . ? ? ? azurix corp . closes sale of azurix north america ? ? 11 / 07 / 2001 ? pr newswire ?

"" however , the consequences of that choice provide less information to me which creates a greater leap of faith in my mind . for example , i have no idea how the mechanics of getting these options done , conveyed to the creditors / buyer / estate / judge works . louise inidicated that it would be a memo or some form of written document indicating the people and total dollars needed to secure them . if that ' s the case , you could add my indemnification amount ( adjusted by probability of payout ) to that total and it surely wouldn ' t blow up the deal . unless , the probability of payout is high . furthermore , i am not proposing that we change the basic employment doc ( subject to comment from my lawyer , but i ' ll try to keep immaterial changes to a minimum ) . i am saying that a condition precedent for me is to negotiate a separate indemnification doc with the buyer . at that point in time , i would hope that they have the time and the inclination to discuss such a doc . perhaps at that time , some of the 2001 comp issues will already be cleared through the bankruptcy judge making the discussion that much easier . based on various discussions with the two of you over the last couple of weeks i have been led to believe that such a decision is expected and perhaps imminent . i don ' t understand why this is a non - starter issue , but i don ' t have the same information that you do . to be clear , here is the basic deal that i am willing to offer as a free option to the buyer : the deal as it exists plus retention payments for those still with the company who deserve them who have not yet received them . indemnification of 2001 comp up to $ 4 million . i expect that the two of you will tell me that i ' m not on the team , that 800 people are going home , and that the portland office will be moved to houston if this thing survives . that is not what i want to happen . if this deal is bigger than me then those things shouldn ' t happen . i have given this a lot of thought over the last couple of days and came up with my conclusions . i am open to any productive discussions that you would like to have . in talking through this stuff with mike and matt i realize what a hard position you guys are in . i feel that i have lost ground rather than gain ground with them in the last couple of days . i trust that you are trying to do the right thing . there are just so many things that are uncertain right now that it makes it very difficult for me to give away the option that you have requested without firming up some other issues for me at the same time . finally , i apologize for hanging up on louise ealier . it ' s probably better than me hearing what she was about to say and her hearing what i was about to say . i will call to see that you received and read this e - mail . i am comfortable with whatever you decide to do . tim"	0
Subject: california update 3 / 15 / 01 executive summary ? davis might concede to rate hikes for future power consumption but not for past utility debt ? davis and pg & e negotiations at a standstill , sticking point is net short for pg & e this summer ? as the days go on with no word of a secured deal , involuntary bankruptcy chances increase significantly among small generators and qfs ? ferc would probably approve transmission deal but with several conditions for california california public utility commission rate increases today may be the turning point as the ca puc reviews the size of the department of water resources ( dwr ) rate increase to be passed along to consumers on their electricity bills . until now , davis has considered rate hikes to be political suicide , but there may be some relief for him from consumer groups . sources indicate that one of california ' s main consumer advocate leaders may tolerate rate increases for future power consumption , but remains adamant about not raising rates to cover past utility debt . dwr , which is currently buying power on behalf of the state , needs more income to securitize the planned $ 10 b bond issue that is key part of davis ' plan to sign long term power contracts . as dwr continues to spend $ 40 to $ 60 m every day on power purchases , a well placed source informed us the dwr is essentially bankrupt . it currently has no money for normal activities such as ordering supplies , purchasing new equipment , etc . the department of finance is forwarding dwr money from where ever it can ( parks , other programs ) to purchase power , but dwr ' s hands are tied until revenue bonds are issued . the california state treasurer phil angelides will be submitting a recommendation on rate increases in order to secure revenue and cover $ 10 billion worth of state bonds . davis & pg & e at odds sources report that davis and pg & e negotiations are facing two difficult challenges : 1 ) pg & e wants 2 . 9 times book , which is far more than consumer groups recommend for the sale of its transmission lines ( sce accepted 2 . 3 ) , and 2 ) pg & e needs relief from davis for pg & es legal responsibility to be the ultimate power purchaser for the state , and at this point davis wants to limit further state energy power purchases ( especially for summer ) . the utilities refuse to sign a deal which will leave them billions of dollars further in the red ( $ 3 to $ 4 b ) and pg a measure that if accomplished would provide davis with even less negotiating power . with all this activity , davis is starting to lose support in the state legislature . sources report increasing tension between the governor and state senate president pro - tem john burton . burton has just announced a special senate committee will investigate the generators for evidence of price manipulation , and the state auditor is also planning an investigation . davis increasingly realizes he has to protect any deal he signs against being picked apart by the legislature and consumer groups later . qf ' s most likely source of involuntary bankruptcy sacramento insiders fear that a group of small generators will lose patience and force bankruptcy on the utilities . sb 47 x may have been california ' s qualified facilities last hope at avoiding an involuntary bankruptcy filing against pg & e , socal ed , and sdg & e . the bill designed to cut the qf ' s costs and provide them with a better rate structure is being held up in the state ' s senate . sources indicate that a filing could come at anytime and further investigations are underway to ferret out the most likely candidates . out with hebert , in with wood the bush administration favors replacing hebert , jr . with texas puc head pat wood . there is an intense battle behind the scenes between senate republican leader trent lott , who favors hebert , and president bush , who wants wood . the administration would prefer wood because they do not want ferc to pick a fight with davis which means bush might ultimately lose some western states in 2004 . in effort to tone down the recent press reports , hebert has made several token concessions to california , including $ 69 million worth of power refunds and streamlining the federal permitting process for pipeline and power plant installation . it ' s is expected that ferc would most likely approve any transmission deal that davis could complete but with a list of conditions . some conditions might include bring the lines formally into the regional grid system as well as other elements to pave the way for more dramatic administrative actions in the west next year . the bush administration is opposed to price caps and believes in free market solutions . the administration is also considering whether it might be a good idea to privatize federally - owned assets such as bpa .	0

Subject: * * * spam * * * 400 % near - term share price growth projection technology breakthroughs ! news for forward - thinking investorsthis tech leader is about to end an embarrassing cruise ship nightmare that has kept their guests in the dark far too long ! reported by : ralph daniels for technology breakthroughs online as soon as a guest steps on board a cruise ship , its like walking backward ten years or so to a time when only a few tech - nuts had the luxury of the internet in the home . believe it or not , todays cruise industry thrusts 9 . 5 million people annually into a technology ba ckwater thats as outdated as not having a phone or tv ! dear profit - seeking investor : this could be one of the most compelling business stories youll come across for some time . 400 % near - term share price growth projectioncompany : in - systcom , inc . ticker : isyjnear - term projection : $ 0 . 80 $ 1 . 00 growth : 400 % / 6 months 2 , 800 % + / 12 - 24 months * * analysis provided in this report . watch for news due out very soon that could send share prices up in a sharp immediate spike of 30 % to 50 % ! imagine the money you would make by offering a population greater than new york city ( about 9 . 5 million people ) with in - home internet and e - mail access for the first time ever ! not just an ordinary population either , but one that is populated with wealth , education , and the desire to travel . that ' s what in - systcom ( isyj ) executives figured a few years back when they pioneered an exclusive technology to deliver internet and e - mail access on cruise ships , using the ships existing wiring ! thats not all . they also pioneered the installation of in - cabin amenities as video - on - demand ( vod ) , satellite tv , video gaming , interactive services , travel and entertainment booking , plus more ! now , after three very successful pilot installations , ( detailed later in this alert ) , and a fourth just completed , in - systcom is now shipping its sealynx system , setting a course for full scale roll - out ! the scope of this business opportunity is staggering . the profit potential even more so . its why this undiscovered stock could soar by 400 % near termgrowing a $ 5 , 000 investment to $ 20 , 000 or more in 6 months or less ! for investors seeking an aggressive play on a low - cost , high potential stock , this one could be a screaming bargain right now . hovering at just . 20 on the pink sheets , isyj has been holding well against the downside , offering a stable entry point pending big news and breakout announcements . and that could come any day now . in - systcom has already deployed their sealynx technology on ships in the prestigious silverseas cruise line and only days ago , announced their second deployment in the oceania cruise line . ( press release 10 / 11 / 2004 businesswire ) thats 4 vessels already , and more news is likely to be released in the coming weeks . all this sets the stage for a move onto otcbbwhich is precisely where company chairman and ceo , will riner , sr . , is ready to take isyj . from there , the breakout could unfold at a skyrocketing pace ! a $ 1 share price by july 2005 ? invest in isyj now , youll be in at around . 20 a share , just preceding the time when next yearsinvestors could be clamoring for shares at $ 1 or more ! t he independent investment advisor the research works projected isyj to trade at $ 1 . 05 by july 2005 . from their report : management has suggested that the silversea contract is the company ' s model for the future . as in - systcom negotiates with other cruise lines representing 40 ships and 32 , 000 cabins , the company expects to gross approximately $ 15 weekly per cabin in revenue as it expands . expanding on those revenue figures yields stunning numbers . in north america alone , 215 , 000 cruise ship cabins ( berths ) represents a total potential market for isyj of $ 167 . 7 million a year ! in - systcoms very reasonable growth strategy , which has been updated to 50 ships over 18 to 24 months , projects to revenues of $ 31 . 2 million a year in 2006 ! and at the current netprofitability of around 31 % of gross revenue , that projects to about 17 eps ! with aggressive growth companies typically trading at 30 to 40 times earnings , isyj could reasonably be a $ 6 to $ 7 stock in 24 months ! longer term , perhaps 24 to 36 months , isyj has all the potential to be a $ 7 to $ 10 stockthats 2 , 800 % to 4 , 000 % growth from todays share price offering investors right now the potential to start small with minimal risk and hit the jackpot ! just $ 2 , 000 invested today could return $ 54 , 000 to $ 78 , 000 in pure profit ! this is the kind of opportunity that could make your dreams come true . and the best part is , the technology is already installed and serving thousands of passengers right now . its just waiting to grow as more and more ships are outfitted with the in - systcom sealynx system ! on the current installation schedule , isyj profits could be com ing on fast . according to projections provided by ceo , wil riner , in - systcom could reach first profitability as early as 2 nd quarter 2005 ! companies on the pink sheets fantasize about the day when they may see revenues , let alone those that turn a profit ! yet in - systcom is projecting profits just a few months from now ! whats more , the current installations are working as planned and revenues are beginning to flow that make profits in q 2 / 05 a very real probability . thus , this is one of those pivotal moments in a companys life that marks a turning point for investors . do you invest nowor do you wait and miss the explosive price surge coming out of pink sheet valuations ? if youre an aggressive investor , the answer should be clear . at todays share price , this could be one of the very best investment decisions you make . even if you limited yourself to just a few thousand shares , you could turn a handsome profit in just a few months , with a very modest downside risk . whats more , by buying now , youll be setting the stage for a major breakout in the future and a fat profit to pad your position ! not a pipe dream . not an rd promise . its real , onboard , and happening now ! since the in - systcom is already operational on a number of ships , serving tens of thousands of passengers , you dont have to wait for the sales department to prove that theres a market either ! new orders should be coming in very quickly . especially as cruise lines see the capabilities of their competitors grow . rather than looking for customers , in - systcom could be faced with the enviable problem of having them line up at the door ! competition ? not any time soon ! this is a fantasy island of profit opportunity ! youll love this part of the show right now , theres no competition to the in - systcom technology ! its the only show in town ! if a cruise line wants internet connections to the cabins , it has two choices . dry dock and retrofit , or choose in - systcom to interface with their existing systems . the growing market and only one source for a sensible solution ! according to more cruise industry statistics , about 87 % ( 8 . 3 million passengers ) of cruise ship passengers boarded north american cruise ships . you know what that means , a whole city full of americans with no personal access to the internet , even for e - mail ! these are people who write big checks for first class service . its reasonable to think that the vast majority of them live by e - mail at home and at work . and since most cruises last more than a week , internet access could be a make - or - break point about booking a cruise . whats more , the problem is getting worse . since the year 2000 , the cruise industr y has grown from 5 . 1 million passengers to 9 . 5 million . by 2010 , the figures are expected to soar past 17 million passengers ! and youre going to deny these people access to the internet ? since most cruise ships were built years ago with wiring that did not anticipate a modern internet , the cruise operators have had nothing to offer except on - board public internet lounges . that just doesnt cut it in 2005 ! the in - systcom solution puts the internet into every cabin on board ! live sports shows and movies too ! from marketing perspective , this could be the right product at the right time for a growing industry . once a cruise company makes the commitment to upgrade to in - cabin internet , e - mail and interactive services , in - systcom can have a fully operational system up and running in a matter of weeks , with no downtime and no disruption to normal cruise activities . in - systcoms technology breakthrough came when it developed an interface that linked the existing phone wiring with the ships c - band or k - band com links . these com links provide the uplink and downlink needed to enable internet and satellite tv access while the in - systcom sealynx system manages the bandwidth possible on the room - to - room wiring network . as reported by in - systcom management , nobody else has this technology nor anything like it . whats more , in - systcom is not just targeting the cruise ship industry ! the resorts at cruise ship destinations face the same dilemmas . high - end resorts on remote is lands face similar challenges providing guests with access to online entertainment , movies and sports programming that their american guests have come to expect . using in - systcom technology , resorts could soon offer a complete menu of in - room entertainment , including internet access and e - mail . that market adds millions more travelers to in - systcoms potential revenue equation . invest now in isyj and you could sit back and relax on a profit - making cruise of a lifetime . and , you can expect your investment will be well managed because even though in - systcom is a relatively new company in - systcom is commanded by a seasoned crew of technology and cruise industry veterans . with veterans like this at the helm , you can be certain your investment will stay true to an aggressive growth course . wil riner , sr . , chairman / ceo / director , has more than 30 years of experience , both domestic and international , in marketing , product development and telecommunications . in 1983 , he received a u . s . patent for the first integrated personal computer workstation featuring a multi - line business phone and multi - tasking capability . in 1986 , mr . riner founded the network connection inc . ( nasdaq : tncx ) , a designer of computer servers and interactive , broadband information and entertainment systems . in 1999 , he helped orchestrate the companys merger with in - flight technologies , then moved on to create in - syst . com inc . , in january 2000 . peter demilio , president , is a former manager of marine technologies for carnival cruise lines , where he m anaged the development and installation of interactive television systems , internet cafes , advanced broadcast television , and satellite telecommunications services . he also owned a technology company devoted to computer graphics , video presentation , and interactive communications . hes also a member of the federal communications advisory committee on the future of interactive telecommunication technology within the maritime industry . wil riner , jr . , vp engineering / director is the former director of sales and marketing of tnci atlanta where he developed domestic and international distribution of the company ' s lines of video server products used in training and entertainment . in 1998 , tnci became the first company ever to install an faa certified digital seat back entertainment system aboard a commercial aircraft . mr . riners other project includes th e sale of shipboard in - cabin digital entertainment system for carnival ' s 900 cabin sensation and carnivals 1200 cabin flag ship triumph ! . stephen stethers , vice president / secretary and a director has more than 15 years experience in the personal computer and network server industries . he is the former vp of operations and project manager for the network connection inc . ( tncx ) , responsible for overall project management and installation of the cruiseview video on demand system isolating dedicated channels for in - house services . mr . stethers has completed projects aboard two cruise ships ( star cruises , malaysia ; carnival cruises , florida ) . what you should do now to lock in this opportunity . at the time of thi s writing , isyj has been trading at $ 0 . 20 per share , so this is the ideal opportunity to lock in a solid position with a small investment . because of isyjs aggressive growth plan is progressing now , you could see rapid share price gains in the coming weeks as news of isyjs accomplishments is announced and investor interest grows . it is reasonable that the current share price represents the very best entry point for new inv estors . however , as can be expected , this is a risky investment suitable only for aggressive investors willing to assume the risk of substantial losses . considering the current state of isyjs growing business and very low price per share , a significant position in the company can be taken n ow putting just a modest investment at risk . 400 % near - term share price growth projectioncompany : in - systcom , inc . ticker : isyj ! near - term projection : $ 0 . 80 $ 1 . 00 growth : 400 % / 6 months 2 , 800 % + / 12 - 24 months * * analysis provided in this report . watch for news due out very soon that could send share prices up in a sharp immediate spike of 30 % to 50 % ! view or chang e your preferences legal disclosure	1

[ proverbs 17 : 17 ] if you do know that here is one hand , we ' ll grant you all the rest . we must all obey the great law of change . it is the most powerful law of nature . they want to be free and they do not know how to be just . it ' s tough to make predictions , especially about the future . avarice is the vice of declining years . an ounce of cheerfulness is worth a pound of sadness to serve god with . none merits the name of creator but god and the poet . flaming enthusiasm , backed up by horse sense and persistence , is the quality that most frequently makes for success . do a little more each day than you think you possibly can . get action . seize the moment . man was never intended to become an oyster . god is a circle whose center is everywhere and circumference nowhere . never swap horses crossing a stream . that is the consolation of a little mind you have the fun of changing it without impeding the progress of mankind . traveling is a fool ' s paradise . our first journeys discover to us the indifference of places . it is not the size of a man but the size of his heart that matters . 	1

Subject: caiso notification - ct 1487 - energy exchange program neutrality adjustment energy exchange program neutrality adjustment charge type 1487 sc settlement contacts : background as you may know , the energy exchange program began on trade date 11 / 14 / 2000 . in this program the iso obtained needed energy in for the real time market and , rather that paying for the energy as a purchase , later returned the energy in another period . this was not necessarily a one - for - one exchange . the incoming energy created a positive neutrality adjustment and when the energy was returned , a negative neutrality adjustment ensued . since the incoming and outgoing energy were usually valued differently , there was a cost shift associated with the transaction that was not cash neutral to the iso . the iso created charge type 1487 was developed for the allocation of the cost to scs participating in the market during the incoming schedules notification the iso has created charge type 1487 so that whenever an energy exchange account is closed or reaches a zero balance , the incurred costs will be calculated and allocated to the sc ' s based on their total negative uninstructed energy over those intervals in which the incoming schedules took place . this new charge type will appear beginning on the june 30 , 2001 statements which will be published on august 23 , 2001 . in addition a few accounts reached a zero balance as early as december , 2000 and therefore allocations may or may not appear on your statement with the rerun data . ct 1487 is a semi automated charge , meaning that the collection of energy data is automated , but it will be a manual charge type within the manual line item records and will not require a change to your settlement system . note that this charge will not appear on every statement , but only when an energy exchange account is closed or reaches a zero balance . if you have any questions , please contact your client relations account manager . client relations communication crcommunications @ caiso . com	0

Subject: forward obligations report issues bill - following are two glitches the real time group has run across with the forward obs report . as i understand , dave poston is getting set to roll out a new version of enpower position manager , which may eventually take the place of many of the reports we run ( forward obs included ) , but in the meantime these are the problems we ' ve seen . thanks so much for your help on this ! 1 . report not reading two identical strips - when deals are extended in scheduling for the same hours , same volume , same price and same counterparty ( using the same deal number ) , the report only reads one strip . for example , on 8 / 6 / 01 , deal 718320 was previously entered as a sale to the california imbalance for 50 mw he 7 - 12 and two separate but identical strips of 25 mw for he 13 - 22 . the report read all 50 mw he 7 - 12 , but only 25 mw he 13 - 22 . i zeroed out one 25 mw strip and aggregated it with the other so the report would read all 50 mw . another example , on 8 / 4 / 01 , deal 718205 is a purchase from ees he 21 - 22 which was also entered as two separate strips of 25 mw each . again , the report read only one of these , and i eventually zeroed out one strip and aggregated it with the other so the report would read a total of 50 mw for those hours . due to the nature of real time deal entry - high volume and a lot of deal extension in scheduling - it would be impractical to aggregate volumes within deals that fall in the same hours at the same price . so i ' m hoping this can be remedied by tweaking the report to read strips with identical terms . please let me know if this is feasible . 2 . report not reading sales at the bc border - this is a new one that cropped up this morning . we made a purchase from a counterparty at the bpa busbar , wheeled the power to the bc border and sold it there . for some reason , although all three deals ( 724366 / 724368 / 724367 ) appear in deal entry and scheduling , the sale at the bc border does not show up in the forward obligation report . after looking into this , i ' ve found no deal entry errors and can only conclude that deal 724367 is simply not pulling into the report . i ' m wondering if this is related to deals done at the bc border , although i don ' t recall seeing this problem before . again , please let me know when and if these report problems can be addressed . i look forward to our next conference call . . . . thanks , kate symes real time trading support 503 - 464 - 3939	0
Subject: do supplemental energy bids matter ? bill , chris , i think this is the market notice you two were refering to . yes , caiso will use the lower of sc - submitted bids or a unit ' s proxy cost for purposes of determining dispatch order and the mcp of supplemental energy and a / s . however , my understanding is that this adjustment only affects the auction for supplemental energy and a / s . if you have costs above the current price cap and your costs are above your unit ' s proxy costs ( and are willing to justify them ) , you should bid your higher - than - proxy costs . if you are accepted , you are supposed to be paid as bid . let me know if you want me to follow up with caiso ( or let me know if you have asked them about this ) .	0

"Subject: stranger ? ? ? hi there stranger ! well i haven ' t spoken to you or heard from you in a few days and i ' m just checkin ' to see that my lil ' buddy in portland isn ' t working himself too hard . as you know i tried to call you tonight but then had to leave for a workout and a scrimmage soccer game . i am so sore ! it ' s out of control ! ok so down to the real reason i ' m writing . brendan and i had a great time at happy hour . we talked a little about you but mostly about life in general . he had mentioned that he had e - mailed me so i rushed home to check it . basically he said all good things but there was one thing that struck me as odd . i guess because he also brought the same point up at the restraunt . he had written that although you thought i was cool and whatever you had commented on how "" strange "" the situation was and he sort of elaborated on that . so the point of this e - mail is i guess to reassure you that i only have the best intentions towards you . i am not trying to be your girlfriend or anything similar to that . to tell you the truth i don ' t even know what your "" romantic "" situation is . i just think you are an awesome guy whom i ' d love to become close friends with . i am ecstatic that you are coming to visit me in huntington beach ( if you still are ) and i ' m thrilled that we can go sight seeing touring together . i bragged and bragged to brendan about what a great guy you were and then came home to feel like maybe you were taken back by my advances . i really am just a very overly affectionate and loving person ( not to mention spontaneous ) . i didn ' t mean to scare you away from having a great friendship with me and me with you . for heavens sake you are my portland connection and i ' m your beach bum buddy . honestly if i were a psycho i would have jumped at the chance to come up and see your condo when you offered . i just think you are someone i ' d love to get to know . especially if you are anything like brendan ( which best friends usually are ) he is such a sweetie ! when he and meg go to visit her mom in la they might just stop over for a visit and of course they are welcome to stay with me as well . i guess i never asked if you had a girlfriend or someone in your life and to be quite honest i didn ' t even think to ask brendan because it ' s not important . i want you , bill , for your friendship and for your companionship now and when i move to portland . reflecting back i realize that i may have written or said something that caught you off guard . it ' s just my personality . i ' m a huge flirt . for heavens sake i was voted "" most flirtatious "" my senior year not to mention "" most likely to succeed "" . probably the second one due to the first but who knows ! hahaha ! i ' m only teasing . ok seriously now bill , i want you to be honest . if i did ( locating your condo etc . ) or said ( like that was the most romantic thing i had ever read that was written by a guy ) something to upset you or give you a false impression i am so sorry . i do find you attractive and perhaps if we lived in the same town or had met a little differently or for that matter i knew your "" romantic "" stiuation , yeah i would have jumped at the chance to have dated you . but we didn ' t and the truth is i can never have too many friends . especially good looking ones that i can introduce to all my "" girl "" friends so that they can be jealous with envy ! : ) like i said i only have the best of intentions towards you and towrds our relationship as friends . but if you are uncomfortable with something i ' ve done or said i am so very sorry and all you have to do is tell me or e - mail me and you ' ll never hear from me again . scouts honor ! i ' ve never been a scout but i ' m not know for my lies either . teehee . i would love to hear any concerns that you might have in regards to our realtionship as friends . if i can i ' ll put your mind at ease if not well i enjoyed our short 30 minute interlude . as always you are still welcome to come visit me and stay with me i would love to have the company . if i don ' t hear form you within the next couple of weeks i ' ll assume the worst but still try to keep my schedule as flexible as possible in case you change your mind . i ' m lucky in the fact that i can do that sort of thing ! : ) ok just e - mail me or call me . let me know that you are alive and kickin ' . i ' ll be leaving for calgary , canada this thursday morning at 6 am and will be there until the 16 th . i ' m so excited this is my first trip out of country but then again you know that ! so i guess i ' ll hear from you when i hear from you . i just thought of a last possible reason . . . i may be way off base here but i am not sure if you know the situation between my boyfriend and myself . he is a real sweetheart and he ' s going to make a wonderful husband and father . . . just not with me . if you are concerned about our friendship and him becoming weird well the majority of my friends are guys and todd is secure enough in himself that he doesn ' t care . if this is about august and you staying with me , my father is moving me down not him and it will be a long time until he can come to visit . also when i get there we are not going to continue a long distance exclusive relationship . i haven ' t dated or had much of a wild stage and i have told him that we will see other people . he ' s fine with that as well . ok i admit that his potland stunt was a little irrational but hey i thought it was thoughtful and darling . i love surprises and little "" extras "" . i just didn ' t expect to have made plans and make myself look like the bad guy to someone whom i ' d never met . therefore i did everything in my power to rectify the situation and make both sides happy and in doing so caused this . you think i ' m a psycho ! not to mention i had to face brendan and before he could read my e - mail you had already revealed the stroy to him ! ! so i got to be embarrssed and a little humbled by the whole experience ! ok that ' s it . take it however you will but it ' s 12 : 51 am and i ' m exhausted ! i did the best i could to figure out and fix a possibly non - existing problem . i hope i did well enough to inspire a response from you . : ) hope to hear or read from you soon ! goodnight and god bless , nikki send a cool gift with your e - card http : / / www . bluemountain . com / giftcenter /"	0

Subject: path confirmation testing of latest release good afternoon : i am looking at version 1 . 0 . 0 . 47 the day i was checking was initally june 23 , but switched over to june 20 th ( new data ) text wrapping : the text wraps in the following fields : counterparty tag comments the text does not consistently wrap in the path field , which is the most critical field to have wrap . missing transmission information : ( june 20 th re - ran to check this ) the transmission information from transl , transloasis seems to be coming thru ( inconsistently ) ; and i still do not see the transmission information from trans 2 , trans 2 oasis represented . i re - ran my data from the 20 th to check it but when . i went to delete my data for the 20 th , and there was none there . do you all know if this data was purposefully removed , or did it just go away ? the only data that seems to have survived to this version is the data from 6 / 23 . sorting : by tag - i see how to make it sort in the strip , but cannot just look at tag numbers . right now in lotus , if i activate the sort by tag i get a list , and if i just start typing a tag number , it takes me to the one i want . can we have that capability duplicated ? by global id - this needs to be able to be done in the upper sort area . expanded view : will the path size in the expanded view be fixed in the next release ? i still cannot see the whole path . the delivery point is blank when i pull this up , but i populated border 1 and 2 . what drives this ? path cut : ( working in june 20 th data ) i was able to sucessfully cut a path - but with the following problems 1 . region still needs to be the forced choice that i mentioned in earlier e - mails 2 . after a path is cut , and i go into the original path , i can ' t see any way to easily find the cut associated with the path . maybe a - go to cut - button 3 . i would like to be able to add incremental hours to a cut , as hourly cuts can go on for several hours but one hour at a time . a new tag might have to be made each hour of the cut . question : in the expanded view of the path under counterparty ; i see a name of a person kind of greyed out . who is this person ? it does not match the trader name on the deal . i looked at williams deal # 633037 . 1 . janelle barsness shows in the path expanded view , but no trader is visible in the trade ( done on eol ) . i looked at wapa deal # 622350 . 1 , kathy crane is in the path expanded view , and penny casey is their trader . that ' s all for now , catch you all on monday cara	0

"Subject: sempra $ 6 . 9 million profit from the west is not much to show for all of the sleeving sempra did for the iso . sempra ' s trading unit generates a windfall by craig d . rose staff writer july 27 , 2001 sempra energy , the parent company of sdg & e , reported a 25 percent surge in profit to $ 137 million last quarter but said yesterday it lost money on the sale of electricity under a long - term contract to california . on the other hand , sempra said its largest source of profits was its energy trading unit , a middleman that earned $ 69 million during the quarter buying and selling energy produced by others . the results underscore the transformation of relatively simple utility companies into diversified energy holding companies that have learned to profit in new ways from the deregulation of electricity and the turmoil in energy markets . the surprising announcement - - that a company lost money selling power during california ' s run - up in electricity prices - - was explained by sempra as an intentional consequence of the long - term contract it signed with the state to provide power . stephen baum , chairman and chief executive officer of sempra , said the company agreed to provide a steep discount to california during the summer months but would recoup the losses later in the 10 - year deal . california sought long - term electricity purchase contracts so it could reduce its purchases in daily and near - term power markets , where prices reached record levels . critics say gov . gray davis rushed into long - term deals because of concerns about getting through next year ' s election . they also say the contracts will saddle customers with higher costs for years . the governor has acknowledged that long - term contracts might cause consumers to pay relatively high prices for electricity in later years , but he maintains it is a fair price to pay for lowering prices that were devastating the state economy . michael shames , executive director of the utility consumers ' action network in san diego , said the steep discount sempra provided to the state on power this summer raised questions about the governor ' s proposal to help san diego gas & electric co . clear a debt of $ 750 million . sdg & e says it is owed that money for power purchases on behalf of its customers . in a media conference last month , davis said the agreement would eliminate the threat of a possible balloon payment for consumers , who he said might have faced the so - called balancing account debt as early as next year . shames says the proposal , which took the form of a memorandum of understanding , or mou , is costly for consumers and a bonanza for sempra . he said the relatively cheap power provided by sempra this summer "" makes the mou sound like more of a hidden payback to sempra than a real relief plan for local ratepayers . "" shames said he will release an analysis of the state ' s sempra plan next week . the state public utilities commission is expected to rule on the plan in august . a sempra spokesman said there is no connection between discount power and the tentative agreement to clear the $ 750 million debt . doug kline , the sempra spokesman , said the power contract with the state was signed in early may and the agreement on the balancing account was reached in mid - june . sempra energy trading , meanwhile , said only 10 percent of its $ 69 million profit was earned from sales of energy in the western region , which includes california . the trading operation earned $ 40 million in profit during the comparable period last year . california ' s independent system operator , which manages most of the state power grid , and other investigators have said trading and bidding strategies were tools used by energy companies to raise prices during the california power crisis . though sempra earned money on trading , its wholesale power generating business lost $ 9 million during the quarter . baum said the discounts on electricity provided the state were the prime cause of the loss for sempra energy resources but added that a plant outage also contributed . sempra energy resources , which co - owns a generating plant near las vegas with reliant energy , earned $ 2 million during the second quarter last year . baum added that sempra ' s long - term contract with the state - - under which it will provide up to 1 , 900 megawatts - - has allowed its wholesale business to pre - sell about half the power it expects to generate from the nevada plant , which will be expanded , and three generating facilities it expects to build . profits at sdg & e slipped to $ 37 million during the quarter ended june 30 , down from $ 40 million last year , according to sempra . sdg & e , whose business is restricted to delivering gas and electricity , said it provided increased customer service during the crisis , which lowered profits . wall street analysts generally applauded sempra ' s results , noting that the company was ahead of its plan to generate at least a third of its profits from its newer businesses by 2003 . "" they ' re really two years ahead of schedule for their non - utility businesses , "" said brian youngberg , an analyst with edward jones & co . bud leedom , a san diego - based analyst with wells fargo van kasper , said sempra ' s move into energy trading now seems shrewd . "" we never dreamed they were setting themselves for a windfall like this , "" leedom said . investors pushed sempra shares up 17 cents yesterday , to close at $ 25 . 49 in trading on the new york stock exchange . bloomberg news service contributed to this report .

Subject:  dear sir / madam , i beg you to carefully go through this email and should it not meet your business or personal ethics , please accept my apologies in advance . my name is david roberts , the chief executive of private clients international of the barclays group with head office at 54 lombard street , london ec 3 p 3 ah . i am writing this letter to solicit for your support and assistance to carry out a project concerning a late customer of the bank by name dr . victor morgan , an oil magnet and philanthropist who died on the 14 th of june 2002 in the london hospital after being involved in fatal car crash which also claimed the life of his wife and two sons . lying in his inactive account in one of our branches is the sum of thirty million united states dollars . ever since he died the bank has placed a stop on all transactions on this account pending when his next of kin would come forward for necessary actions , identification and collection . unfortunately from our investigations and confirmations from his attorney he has no family members who are aware of the existence of the money and as such , we have decided to do business with you . if you stand in as the beneficiary of this funds the money will be released to you , after the due processes have being followed . obviously we do not want this money to go into the bank treasury because the banking law and guideline stipulates that if such fund remains unclaimed for 3 years , the money will be transferred into the bank treasury as unclaimed debt . this would not take too much time to get done as his lawyer already has the necessary letters of administration and court orders from the british high court which are part of the documents required by the barclays bank to process fund release approvals . to do this work 75 % of the money will be for our end , 20 % will be for you while 5 % will be for any xpenses incurred during the transaction . please reach me at my private email address above , if willing to do business with us . thanks and regards , david roberts . disclaimer : this message contains confidential information and is intended only for specified addressee . if you are not the named addressee you should not disseminate , distribute or copy this e - mail . the sender therefore does not accept liability for any errors or omissions in the contents of this message , which arise as a result of e - mail transmission . please note that we reserve the right to monitor and read any emails sent and received by the barclays group under the telecommunications ( lawful business practice ) ( interception of communications ) regulations 2000 . 	1

Subject: re : the stock to watch homeland security investments the terror attacks on the united states on september 11 , 2001 have changed the security landscape for the foreseeable future . both physical and logical security have become paramount for all industry segments , especially in the banking , national resource and government sectors . according to giga , a wholly owned subsidiary of forrester research , worldwide demand for information security products and services is set to eclipse $ 46 b by 2005 . homeland security investments is a newsletter dedicated to providing our readers with information pertaining to investment opportunities in this lucrative sector . as we know , events related to homeland security happen with lightning speed . what we as investors can do is position ourselves in such a way as to take advantage of the current trends and be ready to capitalize on events which have yet to happen . homeland security investments is here to help our readers do just that . with this in mind , it is with great excitement that we present vinoble , inc . this stock is expected to do big things in both the near and long terms . symbol : ( vnbl ) current price : 0 . 08 short term target price : 0 . 35 12 month target price : 1 . 20 * * * why we believe vnbl . ob will give big returns on investment * * * * at this time much of vnbl ' s focus is on rfid ( radio frequency identification ) technology . this is technology which uses tiny sensors to transmit information about a person or object wirelessly . * vnbl is already an industry pioneer in the rfid personal location technology . * vnbl is developing a form of rfid technology which allows companies and governments to wirelessly track their assets and resources . such technology has huge potential in the protection and transportation of materials designated high risk were they to fall into the wrong hands . * vnbl works on integration of the two afore mentioned systems in order to create high security space in locales where it is deemed necessary . locations which may take advantage of such systems are airports , sea ports , mines , nuclear facilities , and more . * as with all stocks , news drives the short term price . fresh news has made vnbl a hot buy . news on vnbl malibu , calif . - - ( business wire ) - - june 16 , 2005 - - vinoble , inc . ( otcbb : vnbl - news ) , a holding company seeking to identify long - term growth opportunities in the areas of homeland security , security information systems , and other security services , announced today that it plans to offer products and services that will assist in the automation of the identification and control of equipment , assets , tools , and the related processes used in the oil gas and petrochemical industries . although small wirelessly networked rfid sensors can monitor machines and equipment to detect possible problems before they become serious , they can also deliver safety features within oil wells . oil maybe trapped in different layers of rock , along with gas and water . detection of specific liquids can assist equipment in operating within a specific precise opportune moment to ensure certain adverse conditions do not occur , such as a well filling with water . as with other rf based technology applications , rfid can also provide the safe transit of materials by only the authorized handler , and limit the entry of personnel to specific locations . ensuring personnel safety is essential , should there be an emergency at a facility , rfid tags would enable the customer to track and evaluate its employee ' s safety and / or danger . this application technology requires product and hardware that can operate in harsh and potentially hazardous conditions , but gives valuable safety to the resources and assets that are vital to the customer . rfid can also assist the customer ' s supply chain by tracking oil , gas , and chemical products from extraction to refining to the sale at the retail level . vinoble ' s viewpoint as previously stated is that these applications are more than just a valuable tool to the mining industry , but as a protective measure of our country ' s natural resources and commodities against threat . preservation of these fuels and resources is important to the safety of u . s . industry and economy . the company believes that such offering service and technology application in the oil gas and petrochemical industry will further position vinoble in a rapidly expanding industry while taking advantage of access to the increasing capital and global spending that the company will require for growth . the company ' s goal is to also provide a much - needed service at a cost manageable to even the smallest of businesses that can ' t afford to do without the safety of its personnel and assets in this current state of constant threat . this is outstanding news . the growth potential for this company is exceptional . in an already hot industry , vnbl . ob stands out as a truly innovative pioneer . we see big things happening to this stock . information within this email contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section 27 a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21 b of the securities exchange act of 1934 . any statements that express or involve discussions with respect to predictions , expectations , beliefs , plans , projections , objectives , goals , assumptions or future events or performance are not statements of historical fact and may be forward looking statements . forward looking statements are based on expectations , estimates and projections at the time the statements are made that involve a number of risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those presently anticipated . forward looking statements in this action may be identified through the use of words such as projects , foresee , expects , will , anticipates , estimates , believes , understands or that by statements indicating certain actions may , could , or might occur . as with many micro -

? island ! ? l that may have virgin reservoirs with similar production potential as the adjacent n pool where 6 wells have produced 680 , 000 barrels oil since 1997 . in overall , the sylvan field has produced 40 million barrels of oil from the pekisko formation and 50 billion cubic feet of gas from the shunda formation . ensign drilling will test a total of 30 feet from several zones in the shunda formation at 7 , 155 feet and a 30 - foot pekisko oil formation at 7 , 320 feet . when drilling resumes , the hole is planned to reach a total depth of 7 , 570 feet , which may take some 10 days to then complete drilling and testing . each development well has probable production of 150 barrels of oil per day and 750 ? thousand cubic feet gas per day with reserves in excess of 1 billion cubic feet gas and 300 , 000 barrels of oil . there are four other pay zones that are prospective for gas . the average well in the sylvan lake field has produced 500 barrels of oil per day and / or over one million cubic feet of gas per day . if successful , the company intends to drill up to 4 more wells on these land sections . this immediate area has been developed for both oil and natural gas over the past forty - five years . accordingly a multitude of gas gathering and processing facilities and oil transportation facilities have been constructed . for more detailed information on this project please see news release dated ( wed , mar 30 ) . good luck and successfu | trading . statements contained in this newsietter may be future - | ooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 . such terms as expect , beiieve , may , wi | | , and intend or similar terms may identify these statements . past - performance is not an indicator of future - resuits . this is not an expert to acquire or se | | securities . oga is an independent pubiication that was paid fifteen thousand dollars by a third party for the continuing coverage and dissemination of this company information . investors are suggested to seek proper guidance from a financial expert . investors should use the information provided in this newsietter as a starting point for gathering additiona | information on the profiied company to aliow the investor to form their own opinion regarding investment . 	1

Subject: please i needed your help . from racheal albert , contact email address : rachealalbert @ netscape . net attn : the director / owner , urgent and strictly confidential how are you ? i know you may be surprised to receive this letter , i am a widow requesting for an assistance . firstly , i am mrs . racheal k . albert . the wife of late mr . k . albert who was recently murdered in the land dispute in zimbabwe . i got your contact through the south african trade and business information services and i assure you that nobody knows about this transaction except me , my two sons . before the death of my husband . he took me to the netherlands to deposit the sum of us $ 15 . 6 million ( fifteen million six hundred thousand united states dollars ) in a private security company , when he foresees the looming danger in zimbabwe . this money was deposited as family valuables to avoid much demurrage cost from the security company . this amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the farms and also for the establishment of a new farm in swaziland . the land disputes started when zimbabwean president mr . robert mugabe introduced a new land act reform which wholly affected the rich white farmers and some few black farmers . this resulted to many killings by zimbabwe war veterans and some lunatics in the society . in fact , a lot of people were killed because of this land reformed act for which my husband was one of the victims . it is on this background that my family and i , who are currently staying in the netherlands as refugees decided to transfer my husband ? s money to a foreign country since the laws of netherlands prohibits refugees from opening a bank account that can contain a huge sum or to be involved in any financial transaction throughout the territorial zones of netherlands . please , i need your assistance to transfer this fund to your trusted overseas bank account . for your efforts and assistance , i have agreed to give you 25 % of the total sum , while 5 % is mapped out to re - imburse all the expenses incurred in the course of this transaction and 70 % will be for my family investment in your country . note that this transaction is 100 % clear and risk - free , as i have made every necessary arrangements for a successful deal . the only thing i solicit you is total assistance to transfer this money , complete trust and assurance that my own part of money will be safe when transferred to your account . kindly , keep this business proposal highly confidential for security reasons . if you are interested in assisting me , send reply via the above email address and include your private phone and fax numbers . i will respond to you immediately . looking forward to your urgent reply , god bless . sincerely yours , mrs . racheal k . albert ( for the family ) get tiscali broadband from Ł 15 : 99 get tiscali broadband from Ł 15 : 99 	1

Subject: goldeditor : charting gold for dummies - an interview with reinhard goldeditor : charting gold for dummies - an interview with reinhard www . goldeditor . com this week gold broke out to new 16 year highs - a great time to get our favorite technical guru , richard reinhard , editor of growth stocks weekly , to give us some of his thoughts on the price of gold ( i know , expectations only cause heartbreak ) . goldeditor interviewed reinhard and he explains in simple detail the mega trend bullishness on gold from a technical point of view . ( don ' t ask him on the fundamentals - he could go on forever ) . sit down in front of the fire and enjoy : goldeditor : why do you emphasize charting , aka technical analysis , when making your investment decisions ? reinhard : technical analysis separates emotions from logic . if we all have the same completely logical expectations prices would only change when quarterly reports or relevant news was released . this would make investing easy . technical analysis ( ta ) is the process of analyzing a security ' s historical prices in an effort to determine probable future prices . we compare current price action ( current expectations ) with comparable historical price action to predict a reasonable outcome . only a small minority of technicians can consistently and accurately determine future prices . however , even if you are unable to accurately forecast prices , technical analysis can be used to consistently reduce your risks and improve your profits . the price of a security represents a consensus - one person is buying and another is selling . the price at which an investor is willing to buy or sell depends primarily on his expectations . if he expects the security ' s price to rise , he will buy it ; if the investor expects the price to fall , he will sell it . ta is based almost entirely on the analysis of the resulting price and volume as evidenced via a chart . a picture truly is worth a thousand words . think of security prices as the result of a head - to - head battle between a bull ( the buyer ) and a bear ( the seller ) . the bulls push prices higher and the bears push prices lower . the direction prices actually move reveals who is winning the battle . support and resistance areas form where strong emotions occur , and can be penetrated by a change in investor expectations ( a shift of the supply / demand lines ) . this type of a change is often abrupt and news based , and often emotional . a trend represents a consistent change in prices ( changing investor expectations ) . trends differ from support / resistance levels in that trends represent change , whereas support / resistance levels represent barriers to change . the use of ta , essentially observing the clues and actions of the crowd , allows you to divorce yourself from what they are feeling . somewhat clinically , you are in a position to anticipate their actions and so act either ahead , with or counter to the crowd - providing a much more timely ( higher probability ) basis for investment decisions . ta provides a basis or frame of reference using a logical and consistent approach that minimizes risks and maximizes opportunities . most investors spend their time looking for easy money ( which is not an easy search ) instead of learning the key factors to security prices - - supply and demand . goldeditor : what are some different technical indicators you use , what do they measure and how do you interpret them ? reinhard : moving averages are one of the oldest and most popular technical analysis tools representing the average price of a security at a given time . many other indicators exist that are beyond a simple explanation , including several of our favorites : fibonacci retracements , relative strength index and on - balance - volume . any good book on ta will explain these clearly to students of the markets . basically , there are three distinct types or classes of indicators , which provide insight into : 1 . the external monetary conditions affecting security prices . this tells us what security prices should do . 2 . the sentiment of various sectors of the investment community . this tells us what investors expect prices to do . 3 . the current momentum of the market . this tells us what prices are actually doing . goldeditor : what are your thoughts on the mega trend in the us dollar ? reinhard : the us dollar is in a secular bear market . you can ' t open a financial newspaper or watch the financial news channels without hearing about the dollar bear . this trend became technically apparent in early 2002 , just like the mirror - image gold price lift - off , yet the press typically provided little if any coverage . with the us dollar ( $ us ) index finally breaking 85 support in recent weeks and gold breaking through the us $ 430 - 435 resistance , we are now clearly starting the next big upwave on gold . the markets are looking somewhat like a rabbit in the road staring at oncoming headlights - frozen in disbelief , fear or confusion . the lag in the gold stocks is symptomatic - but once the trends accelerate away from these key resistance ( gold ) / support ( $ us ) areas there will likely be a rush by the undecided - resulting in an accelerating trend that will surprise the mainstream . there are several technical reasons and many fundamental reasons why a major $ us interim bottom isn ' t likely here and the trend is nowhere near approaching its ultimate end . technically the us dollar index is trading high up in its downtrend near resistance with overhead resistance now building a wall . to see this graphically visit www . gsweekly . com of course the dollar needs to periodically bounce or that fear would get out of hand . technical bounces are a normal part of major downlegs , bleeding off excessive fear and rebalancing investor sentiment . but make no mistake about it , we seeing a slow - motion crash of the us dollar . key to remember is that all major commodities are denominated in us dollars , the world ' s de facto reserve currency . if the dollar is falling , you need more dollars to buy oil or wheat or steel or any commodity . commodity prices across the board are responding to the dollar ' s weakening , but gold has a particularly strong correlation as it is effectively a currency alternative . gold has broken out to 16 - year highs and other metals are following suit . aluminum is selling at multi - year highs , as is copper , lead , silver and nickel . grain prices are surging . if we ' re right about the long - term direction of the dollar ( does it have any choice ? ) , these gains are just the beginning . click here for a usd index chart goldeditor : can you simplify the long term technical story behind gold ? reinhard : in the late ' 90 s gold sank below $ 260 an ounce as the dow headed over 12 , 000 . this was in hindsight the best possible time to leave the roaring tech - boom party and reposition for what will likely be considered the trade of the decade - buy gold . one problem - there was no one ringing the bell that gold had hit an historic bottom ! then in april 2001 gold hit a 21 - year low near $ 250 , very similar to the lows of 1999 , thereby forming a double - bottom . sentiment was understandably negative , with headlined high - profile central bank sell - offs , and predictions of sub - $ 200 gold . as is fairly typical , gold chose its darkest hour to turn into a new secular bull market only now starting to get some mainstream recognition . it ' s easy to focus on the day - to - day ripples , but it ' s the intermediate waves and the secular direction of the tide that really determines where the big money is made , and this big picture perspective continues to set the tone for our somewhat unique early - stage , well - pedigreed , small - cap resource - sector investment focus . ta monitors supply and demand - the key elements that determine price . as long as demand exceeds supply , prices will rise over the long term . the fun to be had is when this equilibrium price is a fair ways away from the status quo , and for many reasons i believe this to be the case . global gold supply only grows incrementally each year because of the difficulty and huge capital costs required to bring new gold deposits to market . gold is a relatively small market where a demand shift leads to magnified price adjustments , especially because unlike a typical commodity , gold is a unique store of value . the key to any secular gold bull is the demand or supply that private investors generate as they buy or sell gold , as this market represents about 80 % of gold ownership . the collective gold transactions of millions or even billions of individual investors worldwide buying and selling gold will ultimately set the price . perversely , in the investment world the higher the price an investment climbs the greater demand becomes . virtually no one wanted anything to do with gold near $ 250 a few years ago , but anyone around in late 1979 through to january 1980 witnessed the madness of the crowd as gold rapidly accelerated to its peak at over $ 850 per ounce . the key to understanding any market bubble ' s distinct parabolic curve is to understand the shifting investment demand over the life of a secular bull . the higher the investment price , the more attention it attracts , the higher demand grows , the higher the investment price goes - a virtuous circle . gold is ultimately a store of value , money , so far simply appreciating to counter the devaluing us dollar . many currencies such as the euro and the commodity - based canadian dollar are also appreciating strongly relative to the us dollar . when gold starts appreciating from the foreign investors ' home - currency perspective , maybe as a result of their government ' s determination to remain competitive through competitive devaluation or a lowering of interest rates , the rush to own gold should accelerate . click here for a three year gold chart goldeditor : so many people have said that gold ' s critical level is $ 430 - why is that ? reinhard : gold has often been repulsed by overhead supply at this price point , although the number $ 430 has no particular significance other than to be well north of where resistance is usually met . just earlier this year enthusiastic gold investors were financially bagged when gold ' s largely uninterrupted run from the january 2001 $ 250 area double bottom came to an abrupt halt on january 13 2004 at $ 426 , corrected to $ 390 , ran again to $ 427 in april ( a double top ! ) and then plunged to the $ 375 area in short order . this of course caused magnified volatility amongst the junior gold stocks . looking back further , this is the same area that marked the january 1996 peak , january 1990 top , january 1987 resistance and even the late 1979 correction before the breakout to the ultimate $ 850 secular peak . for whatever reason , demand seems to meet supply in this area , and of course the market ' s always right ! on october 25 , 2004 gold closed at $ 429 , to me a key close and the highest since february 1990 ' s high close of $ 424 . interestingly , gold has barely pulled back at all these last 3 weeks ( the low was $ 424 on 2 days ) and in fact has been trading consistently above $ 430 with progressively higher closes since november 4 . today ' s close ( november 16 ) was $ 439 . 40 . can you spell stealth breakout ? goldeditor : is $ 430 the big support level now ? reinhard : the $ 425 area has built up significant support over the last month . any significant breakdown through the area would of course be a cold shower for the gold market , causing no small amount of painful readjustment to some leveraged portfolios as offside investors liquidate . interestingly , this is not an extended , over - bought market . in fact , many traders and gold bugs would have faded into this key resistance zone - that is , sold as price entered the resistance area . this is the reason old resistance becomes new support once breached decisively . trader ' s remorse is a well - known phenomenon . market traders who sold and investors who missed the run are now even more anxious to ( re ) establish positions , hoping to see price come back , and afraid to chase the price up . goldeditor : has gold broken out for good ? reinhard : yes . gold has now broken out and is on a trend that is unlikely to change for some time . the trend remains intact until it is broken . right now from both a fundamental and technical perspective i ' m convinced that we are setting up for a run to test the $ 480 - 500 area . goldeditor : where do you think the next major resistance level is ? reinhard : a re - visit to gold ' s long term chart shows that once the $ 430 area is cleared next resistance will be met at around $ 500 , and above that it ' s about $ 720 . again , this is historical and based on several distinct data - points separate in time , lending some confidence to each level ' s ongoing significance . $ 500 also has that large round number psychological aspect to it . goldeditor : how does investor psychology affect charting patterns and technically ? reinhard : some key observations investors need to consider : 1 . price represents the fair market value as agreed between buyers ( bulls ) and sellers ( bears ) . 2 . changes in price are the result of changes in investor expectations of the security ' s future price . 3 . support levels occur when the consensus is that the price will not move lower . it is the point where buyers outnumber sellers . 4 . resistance levels occur when the consensus is that the price will not move higher . it is the point where sellers outnumber buyers . 5 . the penetration of a support or resistance level indicates a change in investor expectations and a shift in the supply / demand lines . 6 . volume is useful in determining how strong the change of expectations really is . 7 . traders ' remorse often follows the penetration of a support or resistance level as prices retreat to the penetrated level . which means what ? the sellers feel stupid for having sold and want back in ! goldeditor : technically speaking where do you think the critical level is for gold to hold for the bull market remain intact ? reinhard : if one looks at the 4 - year chart , effectively covering the double - bottom of early 2001 and the full move of this first phase of what is now a new secular bull market , a clear channel can be plotted which bounds the higher - lows and higher - highs with parallel up - trend lines . today , to break the bottom trend line we would need to see price break down through the $ 390 area , and then there still exists major support at the old resistance band around the $ 375 level . a break in the established uptrend would not negate the bull market , but a breakdown through major support would put it in jeopardy - effectively the lows of april 2004 would need to be breached to the downside . goldeditor : why are some of the gold stocks not breaking out with the price of gold ? reinhard : actually very few gold stocks are breaking out or achieving new highs along with the price of gold . there are probably several reasons for this , but a major one has to be investor ' s reluctance to buy when price is perceived to be at the top of a trading range - a been there , done that , won ' t do that again psychology . this will change once the gold price leaves this range behind and investors start to believe there ' s upside . a once bitten twice shy memory is strong - fear will need to be overcome by greed . another factor to consider is that there was a record amount of financings last year as long - suffering juniors took advantage of the first wave to load up the treasury at relatively cheap prices . there ' s a lot of paper that needs to be absorbed . the hui gold share index has gained about 600 % over the last 3 - 1 / 2 years and most investment managers and retail brokers missed the market . typically any bull market ' s first phase is marked by denial and this one is no different . by the time phase two progresses to the point that average people start to become aware and accept that this is for real , we should see some serious professional capital to inflow to the sector . once the senior companies do become fully or overvalued in anticipation of gold ' s continued rise , there will be a natural migration of investment capital to the undervalued intermediate and then junior sectors . because it takes three to five years to find a decent discovery , and another several years to build a mine - there ' s no quick way to catch up for the lack of exploration and development of the 1997 - 2002 resource slump , and so to position into perceived value will mean buying into deserving early - stage opportunities now , or pay - up down the road . resources are now scarce , and the competition from investors , funds , mining companies and foreign countries will only become more intense until somehow supply increases to the point where demand is met - and this is unlikely to occur for several years . goldeditor : do you buy strictly on technical behaviors or do you combine technical behavior with fundamentals and why ? reinhard : you need both . there have been many scams and market manipulations where the technicals were orchestrated to be compelling . likewise , the fundamentals are often manipulated ( remember bre - x ) in an effort to deceive . at least with bre - x the technicals would have stopped you out even as the story remained compelling . it ' s never a good idea to ignore one entirely , although if i had to make a choice , technical analysis and good money management discipline is all one needs to make consistent returns . goldeditor : what is your biggest trading rule ? ( i . e . never average down , first loss is always the best lost etc . ) reinhard : a rising tide raises all ships , and vice versa , so assess the tide , not the ships . some honorable mentions that have served me well : be patient : don ' t be rattled by fluctuations . when all you ' re left with is hope , get out . never catch a falling knife . cut your losers , and let your winners ride . bear markets begin in good times . bull markets begin in bad times . draw trendlines . if a stock is in a downtrend don ' t go long , and visa versa . if you learn one candlestick pattern , learn doji at the top of a trend . contrarians are correct at turning points in the market , but wrong the rest of the time . goldeditor : what books do you recommend for the beginning trader ? reinhard : technical analysis of the financial markets : a comprehensive guide to trading methods and applications by john j . murphy trading for a living : psychology , trading tactics , money management by alexander elder financial reckoning day : surviving the soft depression of the 21 st century by william bonner reminiscences of a stock operator by edwin lefvre goldeditor : richard , thank you for your insights on the price of gold . i ' m sure your technical expertise has helped many of our subscribers be better investors . we are going to do an update with you in six months . we look forward to talking to you then . to unsubscribe from this publication , please click on the box below . gold editor po box 48451 bentall centre vancouver , bc v 7 x la 2 canada 	1

( otc - bb : dcpi ) dcpi has developed a revolutionary digital printing technology recognized to be the solution to variable graphical / color printing processes by industry leaders such as ibm ( nyse : ibm ) ; xerox ( nyse : xrx ) and siemens ( nyse : si ) whose products only print in black via laser products . dcpi ' s commercial printing application hardware / software and printing consumable products are expected to dominate the printing enhancement market ( $ 5 billion plus + + in 2002 ) over the next several years . dcpi ' s initial target market of more than 4 , 000 large scale commercial printing companies of the total of 46 , 000 establishments is expected to drive revenue growth to the tens of millions within its first few years , further providing an ongoing revenue stream from the sales of printing consumable products for years to come . special investment alert digital color print , inc . ( otc bulletin board : dcpi ) current price : $ 1 . 25 shares outstanding : 24 . 6 million market capitalization : $ 31 million short term target : $ 3 . 00 12 month target : $ 9 . 00 a few reasons to own dcpi : digital color print , inc . ( dcpi ) , through it ' s wholly owned subsidiary logical imaging solutions ( lis ) , is in the business of supplying high - speed digital printing systems and supplies to the commercial printing industry . the printing systems are unique in technical concept and application . the systems are totally digital , designed to mount on existing offset web presses and significantly improve the functionality of the press , not as a replacement - but as an enhancement . the printing process is called electron beam imaging ( ebi ) , and is significantly faster the convention laser printing - the only partially competing technology . printing is america ' s third largest manufacturing industry ; employing more than 1 . 2 million people in almost 46 , 000 establishments . the printing industry , during 2002 , produced over $ 165 billion of printed products and purchased $ 4 . 5 billion of hardware and $ 7 . 7 billion of consumable products . nyse - listed dover corporation , the largest manufacturer of offset web presses , estimates that there are more than 35 , 000 presses installed in the u . s . , with a press costing from $ 150 , 000 to several million and using as much as $ 10 , 000 of consumable products per month . offset presses print all types of documents ; forms , labels , tickets , tags , advertisements and direct mail pieces , at production rates of 500 pages - per - minute ( ppm ) to thousands of ppm . however , the printed materials produced are each identical , as each image printed is the offset inked image derived from the printing plates that are mounted on the offset press . the great limitations of the offset process are that each image ( page ) remains identical unless the printing plates are changed . also the inking of the plates requires the laborious tasks of mixing the inks for each plate , inking the plates and then cleaning the press for the next job . if the print job requires variable information , such as ; name , address , bar codes , dates , prices , this must be added in a distinctly separate print operation . typically this task is performed by expensive data processing laser printers , manufactured by either xerox , ibm or oce ' ( formerly , siemens printing systems ) . the laser printers print only in black . lis printing systems are designed to mount directly on most offset web presses and allow for the printing of any type of data or graphics , without limitation , and in line with the offset presses traditional production of a colorful end product . as a simple example : in the production of an event ticket such as a superbowl ticket , all fixed or non - variable information , such as the colorful photo - quality front cover and the stadium rules and disclaimers on the reverse side of the ticket are produced by plates on an offset press ; identical information on each ticket . a second printing process is then required to add the variable information , which includes the section , seat and row numbers , price and date of the event . this function can be accomplished , in line , by an lis provided system . lis printing systems are entirely digital and are dry toner based , which precludes the laborious press set - up and clean - up tasks , ink mixing and storage and the production of printing plates . the pressman simply runs the paper directly through lis ' s printer and it becomes an integral part of the press and the starting and stopping of the press and the placement of the digital object on the page are all under the control of lis proprietary software . nyse - listed dover corporation , the largest manufacturer of offset web presses , estimates that there are more than 35 , 000 presses installed in the u . s . , with a press costing from $ 150 , 000 to several million and using as much as $ 10 , 000 of consumable products per month . dcpi ' s digitalcolorpress was designed to be installed on the majority of these presses , extending their life and utility by providing the printing of computer generated variable data in - line with the offset printing function . further , the system eliminates the need for preparing and storing printing plates , and inks and the expensive tasks of setting up a press for a print run , followed by tearing down after each job , cleaning the press and setting up for the next print job . dcpi estimates that the majority of printers will upgrade to color during the first two years of the digitalcolorpress availability and thousands more commercial printers will purchase systems through dcpi ' s direct sales force and distribution channel during the next two years . dcpi ' s first growth step is to increase consumable inventory to support existing lis systems , each installation generates about $ 6 , 000 per month in consumable purchases . secondly , to make lis ' s unique color press available from inventory and expand the current number of installed sites . thirdly , make the product offering available to the commercial printing industry . large tasks , but currently without any perceived competition or technological limitation . this stock will see major upward movement in the next several weeks . right now , dcpi is one of the street ' s best kept secrets , but it will not remain that way for long . this is a unique opportunity to get in while trading levels are still low . as the company goes forward with its business plan and signs major new contracts , this stock will move quickly . this is your last chance to invest before dcpi begins major price appreciation . this stock could reach $ 3 . 50 in the next five trading days ! the writers , pr firm , mailers involved in the creation , and distribution of the information above are not a registered broker / dealer and may not sell , offer to sell or offer to buy any security . this profile is not a solicitation or recommendation to buy , sell securities . an offer to buy or sell can be made only with accompanying disclosure documents from the company offering or selling securities and only in the states and provinces for which they are approved . the material in this release is intended to be strictly informational and based on assumptions rather than fact . the companies that are discussed in this release have not approved the statements made in this release nor approved the timing of this release . all statements and expressions are the sole opinion of the creators and are subject to change without notice . information in this release is derived from a variety of sources including that company ' s publicly disseminated information , third parties and the writers research and optimistic speculation . the accuracy or completeness of the information is not warranted and is only as reliable as the sources from which it was obtained . all involved in the creation and distribution of this profile / release disclaims any and all liability as to the completeness or accuracy of the information contained and any omissions of material fact in this release . the release may contain technical and factual inaccuracies or typographical errors . it is strongly recommended that any purchase or sale decision be discussed with a financial adviser , or a broker -

"Subject:  poisoning diagnosis ' rock solid ' ( cnn ) - - the doctor who has overseen the treatment in vienna of ukrainian opposition leader viktor yushchenko says the diagnosis of dioxin poisoning is "" rock solid , "" but says more information must be obtained before medical authorities can determine the candidate ' s prognosis . dr . michael zimpfer told cnn sunday that he based his conclusion on a physical examination of the patient and "" various blood tests "" carried out at vienna ' s rudolfinerhaus clinic and elsewhere . zimpfer told reporters over the weekend that the concentration of dioxin in yushchenko ' s body was "" 1 , 000 times above the normal levels "" and that he suspected "" third - party involvement . "" the revelation prompted ukraine ' s prosecutor - general to reopen a probe into the opposition leader ' s illness . "" we have sent samples to a lab within europe and also to labs across the atlantic ocean that claim to have vast experience , and they came up with the results , "" zimpfer told cnn late sunday . yushchenko has "" a tremendous amount of dioxin in the blood , "" zimpfer said , so much that "" it ' s beyond the scale . "" yushchenko has accused ukrainian authorities of having tried to poison him in the run - up to november ' s fraudulent presidential election . ukraine ' s supreme court voided the outcome after yushchenko lost to prime minister viktor yanukovich , and a rerun of the contest is slated to be held on december 26 . the 50 - year - old , then - telegenic campaigner was taken to the vienna hospital in september , when he first fell ill . he resumed campaigning later in the month but with a pockmarked and badly disfigured face . given what little medical information has been released publicly , yushchenko could have been exposed to any of about 20 dioxins or dioxin - like chemicals , said dr . arnold schecter , professor of medicine at the university texas school of public health at southwestern medical center in dallas ."	1

Subject: urgent assistance . from : ms sarah guei cocody , abidjan cote d i ' voire this mail may be a surprise to you because you did not give me the permission to do so and neither do you know me but before i tell you about myself i want you to please forgive me for sending the mail without your permission . it is because i need your assistance and please mail me on my private box as stated below . my name is sarah adidi guei , the daughter of the late military ruler of ivory - coast ( retired brigadier general robert guei ) who was assasinated in a political crisis which led to war in my country ( ivory - coast ) on 19 th september , 2002 . my father , mother and two junior brothers were killed by some soldiers believed to be loyal to the government because of my father ' s objection to some certain policies of the present government . i was lucky to have escaped with a brother who is the last child of the family that night because we were visiting a family friend in another city far away from our home . i have to go into hiding with my junior brother for some days before arrangements were made for us to leave ivory - coast for the republic of togo on the invitation of president eyadema of togo who granted us political assylum . before we left for togo , i visited our home where my mother and my two junior ones were killed in our village and during the search for some documents in my father ' s room came accross some vital documents and the keys to a secret vault in the house . i took the keys and went down to where the vault is and there i discovered two metal boxes which were carefully hidden . with the aide of the documents i was able to open the boxes only to find out that the boxes were full of money in hundred dollar bills . i could not count the money because i was very shock to see it and again it is too much for me to count but the documents that i discovered in his room which led me to the boxes put the money at $ 10 , 000 , 000 ( ten million usd ) . i locked it back carefully and arranged for the boxes to be moved with me through the help of some family friends to abidjan the capital city where i deposited it with a security company for safe - keeping . i did not declare the content of boxes to the security company , i only declare it as family valuables . when the african leaders came to ivory - coast and president eyadema invited us to go to the republic of togo where i now live with my junior one . i cannot touch the money and even afraid to tell it to our family friends who have been coming to visit us in togo . i decided that it will be better to move the money abroad where i can put to safe and have it invested . this has been my reason for contacting you . i would have given you my telephone number so that you can call me in order to discuss the issue better but i ' m afraid to do so because we have too many people around us who i would not want to know of the money . it will be better for me to communicate through internet until we can make proper and solid arrangements about how to move the money . i wish to meet with you if you can make a trip to the republic of togo or ivory - coast , then we can meet secretly before we go ahead for the transaction . i am ready to offer 20 % of the money to you for this assistance . it is not that i am paying you but for your assistance which i shall really appreciate . please i wish that this assistance be treated highly confidential . waiting to read your response about the proposal soonext . private mail : gasarahl 25 @ netscape . net thanks , sarah guei . 	1

Subject: re : var for credit trading ted thanks for the note - coming from jpmorgan i understand the importance of var as a key control measure and i appreciate that we may all need to do further work to ' institutionalise ' a var culture in enron . however , in this instance , i believe the initial comment has been taken out of context . i believe there is a general communication issue here . since inception the business has been monitoring risk via the use of a cumulative sensitivity measure for the portfolio - expressed and reported as dvolon the daily dpr . however , no - one in rac / commercial / commercial support appears to have formally equated that sensitivity to the business var limit during the longer than expected delay to the completion of a signed off var model . ( informally this is being done ) i would have expected the business to utilise a crude ( and possibly necessarily overstated ) scaling factor based on the volatility of credit spread movements in the market and for rac to have signed off this scaling factor . bryan seyfield and david wall will propose this immediately . finally , i believe both commercial and commercial support for credit trading are reprioritising the work being completed for the model for var reporting - we should communicate the new delivery date as soon as possible . i look forward to discussing this and other rac / commercial support interface issues with you next week regards mike from : ted murphy 26 / 06 / 2000 14 : 50 to : sally beck / hou / ect @ ect , mike jordan / lon / ect @ ect , fernley dyson / lon / ect @ ect , bryan seyfried cc : rick buy , richard causey / corp / enron @ enron subject : re : var for credit trading please see the attached comment at the bottom of this string of e - mails . the privilege of using enron ' s balance sheet comes with the responsibility to adequately report the risk in the form that has been agreed to . it is appalling to me that we are currently incapable of calculating var in a product that has been approved for trading for several months . it is equally appalling that the support staff continues to be so unaware of the importance of this that the comments below could even be considered reasonable . obviously , the individual who made the comment is hardly responsible . it lies with both commercial and commercial support management . i know that airing this out in such a broad way appears to be harsh . this is not the point . this is not an isolated problem . it is not just pertaining to europe . please do not feel singled out . but the scrutiny and pressure on var as a measure of risk continues to grow at fast pace . we can hardly make any progress if this is the pervasive attitude . let ' s knock this stuff out one at a time . ted oliver gaylard 06 / 26 / 2000 08 : 34 am to : david port / market risk / corp / enron @ enron cc : chris abel / hou / ect @ ect , michael e moscoso / hou / ect @ ect , david a wall / risk mgmt / lon / ect @ ect , ted murphy / hou / ect @ ect subject : re : var for credit trading the var engine for credit trading is being built by research in london and it is intended that var be run daily as soon as they have produced / signed off on this . oliver from : david port @ enron 26 / 06 / 2000 14 : 24 to : chris abel / hou / ect @ ect cc : michael e moscoso / hou / ect @ ect , david a wall / risk mgmt / lon / ect @ ect , oliver gaylard / lon / ect @ ect , ted murphy / hou / ect @ ect subject : re : var for credit trading my view : prove its insignificant by calculating it every day , that ' s why the board approved the limit . dp chris abel @ ect 06 / 23 / 2000 07 : 41 am to : david port / market risk / corp / enron @ enron cc : michael e moscoso / hou / ect @ ect subject : var for credit trading fyi - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by chris abel / hou / ect on 06 / 23 / 2000 07 : 38 am - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - mary thambiah 06 / 23 / 2000 03 : 29 am to : chris abel / hou / ect @ ect cc : david a wall / risk mgmt / lon / ect @ ect subject : var for credit trading hi chris i talked with david yesterday and we don ' t think the risk is significant enough to start calculating a var number . however if you have any queries feel free to give him a call . rgds mary	0

"Subject: re : project doorstep responsibility matrix thanks for the summary . i was out last week so apologies if my comments arrive too late . here they are anyway : 1 socrates i think it inappropriate for me , or anyone in rac for that matter , to have primary responsibility for this system / project . but if i were responsible the first thing i would want to know is why this project , which commenced in may 1998 , as i recall , is still incomplete , given that it now contains possibly the largest energy derivative position in history , concentrated in a single commodity with a single counterpart . 2 exhaustive ? it doesn ' t look like an exhaustive list and i suspect it was not intended to be so - nevertheless we should ensure it is not viewed as such . 3 symptoms or causes ? many of the points look like the former , and addressed as they stand will likely leave us with a band - aid solution which will drop off when pressure is applied . in fact many of them look like they are a result of point 5 : "" prioritisation of system projects has resulted in a lack of certain control functionality . . . "" because that explains partly why models get built and forgotten , confirmation errors get made , deliveries go astray and trades get missed - usually bright people are simply too immersed in manual processes to have time to think about changing the way they work . and , for example , when those people move on , as they surely will , the institution has no memory of how to do what they did . i am still amazed at how much we pay relatively senior people to work on microsoft excel all day , everyday . 4 overall i think this is a good exercise if we react to it in the right way . rather than a list of irritating issues we have to do just enough to justify ticking off , we should use it as a tool to analyse the way we operate . as a hypothesis , if most issues stem from point 5 , then i would ask why has prioritisation of system projects resulted in a lack of certain control functionality ? dp brent a price @ ect 05 / 08 / 2000 11 : 08 am to : mike jordan / lon / ect @ ect , steve w young / lon / ect @ ect , tani nath / lon / ect @ ect , mark pickering / lon / ect @ ect , joe gold / lon / ect @ ect , james new / lon / ect @ ect , richard lewis / lon / ect @ ect , michael r brown / lon / ect @ ect , andrew cornfield / lon / ect @ ect , tim davies / lon / ect @ ect , rebecca millerchip / lon / ect @ ect , kevin sweeney / hou / ect @ ect , pablo pissanetzky / lon / ect @ ect , gail hill / lon / ect @ ect , eric virro / lon / ect @ ect , richard sage / lon / ect @ ect , tim poullain - patterson / lon / ect @ ect , ian sloman / lon / ect @ ect , david port / market risk / corp / enron @ enron cc : fernley dyson / lon / ect @ ect , sally beck / hou / ect @ ect , ted murphy / hou / ect @ ect , john sherriff / lon / ect @ ect subject : project doorstep responsibility matrix attached is a responsibility matrix for london - project doorstep action steps . the listing consists of controls findings , action steps , proposed timelines , and proposed sponsors and responsibility assignments for the completion of the action steps . the purpose of this matrix will be to review and monitor it on an ongoing basis to ensure that items are being appropriately addressed and completed . please take a moment to review all sections of the listing and communicate any comments or revisions you may have to me as soon as possible . we would like to have a final version of this document in place by may 12 ."	0

Subject: transparently controlling the wholesale trading businesses - an internal approach to internal audit shawn / shona we have talked round this issue for some time so i thought i would try to take a brief stab at documenting what my preferred approach is ( we will need to do a great deal of talking before we would circulate widely ) : - aims accountability for internal controls must rest with the commercial support teams and absolutely with the leaders of those teams . a culture of control and operational risk assessment requires extensive on - going communication and a structure of measurement and tracking . any independent process of review such as doorstep and brm should fully leverage the work engaged by staff in the line and indeed should be focused by it all elements of implementing , completing and reviewing internal control should generate defined output we focus independently the review efforts for trading controls and origination controls ( we have defined the control structure for trading offices , agency offices and origination offices and we must police our labelling for each office ) the output from enron ' s perspective is appropriate risk issue lists to be discussed at control / governance meetings ( eg at sally / ted / fernley ' s level and at the audit committee level ) - the important issue here is that every list must be extracted from an agreed database of issues - different lists have different amounts of filtering applied - judgementally by senior / experienced staff the output from aa ' s perspective is their internal controls audit opinion based upon our database and our review and management process of it trading process - monthly routine judgemental self assessment on areas within the trading transaction cycle - rating made by business controller is red , amber , green - with trend indicator of static , improving or declining - see attachment 2 for full listing monthly metrics collected for key standards set for risk management - see attachment 1 ( you will notice that this is a summarised version of attachment 2 - and as a senior controller i would expect the metrics to underpin but not solely drive the judgement within the self assessment ) - shona , this is the work that mike moscoso is leading periodic review meeting between controller and commercial lead to discuss operational risk and areas of concern ( red and amber ) with agreement of action plans for such areas monthly review by controller / senior controller of database where all high ( red ) and medium ( amber ) risk issues are recorded . milestones for action plans revisited , reconfirmed or amended monthly meeting between remote office staff and controllers to identify if the risk rating for any remote offices has changed all new information on issues raised by self assessment , doorstep review or brm completion populated into database database utilised globally to report to various levels of governance and decision on whether original brm and doorstep plans require amendment process - yearly planning checkpoint taken of current operational environment ( say end oct ) proposed new offices for coming year or proposed changes to activity in office , and it development plans for next year prioritisation made for doorstep - which offices require a visit and what depth does report need to go to . note the doorstep review would be an end to end review for entire business unit and therefore is the independent review of the existing self assessment and would leverage the work by focusing the review effort on areas of concern , the actions plans in place and concluding on the ' mitigation of operational risk to an acceptable level ' prioritisation made for brm - which functions , not business units , require external independent review - highly leveraging the above self assessment and doorstep processes ( could aa signoff simply by auditing our own internal governance process ? ) - most likely reviews completed on functions that assessed as concerns across multiple business - such as fx exposure management , cash management , credit exposure management , it change management controls / process where are we now - if we all thought to do this immediately we do not have bottom up operational risk assessment for all businesses - i am suggesting that we demand that all business controllers at the houston offsite do this ? 23 rd oct the above would validate a high level operational risk summary that we as senior controllers could put together for the audit committee - last week oct we agree on a robust tracking process - throw out one of the brm and doorstep databases - november given aa have never historically risk rated their issues we should repopulate the database from scratch - november review doorstep plan to check that our risk rating for business units and remote offices means that we have resource focused correctly - do we need to visit all ?

"Subject: re : limit violations and notifications process shona - rac and risk ops are in this together and of course we ' ll continue to help in understanding the violations . i recognize and sympathize with the strain your group is under with all the systems problems , the uk dpr issues , the increased limit change and policy compliance activity , etc . . my suggestions were : 1 ) meant to streamline the process for you by making your data gathering process easier , 2 ) i was offering to "" be the bad guy "" and point out to the traders what we want them to do , and 3 ) meant to strengthen the effectiveness of our risk management framework in this environmeant of increasing exposure and volatile markets by reinforcing to the traders their accountability for their positions and compliance with the policy limits . i think the confusion here is violation explanations being "" validated "" by the traders as you indicated below , vs . "" provided "" by the traders as we envision . i confirmed with ted , the traders are accountable for providing the explanation . i ' m not sure how the suggestions below would be a set back to your efforts of getting memos out earlier . we ' re suggesting the traders should provide you with explanations first thing in the morning , so that you do not have to go through all the effort as you do now , of trying to track people down in the afternoon and get explanations . it should be the traders responsibility to get them to you , and they should be reviewing their positions every morning before they even begin trading . , and should be able to easily explain why they ' re in violation or why they had a big loss . whether the traders call your group directly and leave a voice mail , or they talk to their ops business unit controller who relays the explanation to you - whatever you think makes sense and works for you . i ' m not trying to manage the process , just to help design one that makes it easier for you and is still effective from a risk management stand point . at this point in this long series of e - mails , why don ' t we just talk face to face . i can tell from your response you feel we ' re somehow not being team players , but that is not my intent at all . i ' ve tried to go out of my way the past few weeks to tell you and your group how much market risk values and appreciates your efforts . and really , i thought i was helping by using the policy ' s influence to help develop a better process that would decrease the time and effort your group has to spend on the policy compliance reporting . perhaps a meeting with you and i and sally would be appropriate . we can talk about this and any other questions or concerns you might have with rac ' s expectations . i agree , we do have significant mid - office needs , and you have been absorbing more tasks in the past couple of months since i joined rac ; and my view is our needs seem to only be increasing as additional risk reporting is required every day by skilling . we can continue to work on streamlining processes , but maybe we need to think about staffing in our respective groups and corresponding responsibilities . i ' m willing to do whatever is needed , and i don ' t think ted is hung up on who does what either . it ' s just that right now we ' re staffed with the expectation that sally ' s group handles the reporting and ongoing data maintenance type of activities related to our risk management systems . best regards , cassandra . -

to share with the others our telephone discussion , the notification template was not my request , it was requested directly by skilling . i know your group is working hard to meet mangagement expectations , and in accordance with your request below , market risk is happy to help you transition into this revised reporting format by reviewing the template prior to your distribution until you are comfortable with the reporting requirements . the new p / l notification limits and limit changes that will be in effect next tuesday should dramatically decrease the number of notifications , so that should help . it probably makes sense to re - distribute the policy to your business unit controllers and the traders so they understand the policy requirements . another issue that we discussed yesterday is the source of the violation explanations . these should be provided to you by the head trader of that commodity group . under the policy , that commodity group manager is responsible for compliance with the risk management policy for the commodities under his responsibility , along with the head of the energy ops for that commodity group . if the traders are not providing these explanations to you or to your counterparts ( ops desk head / business unit controller ) , i ' ll be happy to send them an e - mail explaining their compliance obligation under the policy . why don ' t you talk to each of the business unit controllers , consider whether a process is already in place for this feedback ( as i understand it is for global products , for example ) , and if you ' d like me to send an e - mail to whoever you ' re having difficulty with , i will - just let me know who . our market risk desk heads will be happy to review their explanations , but the problem is , they can see whether they ' re short or long and how the market moved in comparison , but it ' s the trader that can and should explain why they took a position , whether they ' re adjusting it based on the market moves , etc . . let me know what else i can do to help streamline the process . regards , cassandra . -

mail is ok for ted , david and i . i have a few other suggestions on format / reporting changes as well . the na power var of $ 51 mm was not 105 % over its var limit of $ 50 - that would have been $ 52 . 5 to require a report to skilling , ( but if we had had to report it , don ' t use "" wscc "" , try to spell out or just don ' t use ) uk gas ' s var limit is not $ 4 , it ' s $ 7 . 5 mm i can ' t tie in uk gas ' qtd and ytd p / l - shouldn ' t it be what ' s on the dpr , adjusted for the portion of the structured derivatives that is gas - call over to that yeo person and get the info . from them please the 2 nd item for na gas shouldn ' t be listed like that as it looks like another violation - the comment re : the var increase was mean to go at the bottom under rac comments the finance committe chairman notification for agg . var is not 100 % , it ' s 115 % ( notification requirement box ) ees had a var violation - $ 7 . 5 vs . 7 - that is a skilling level violation let ' s have the "" re : "" say "" limit violations and notifications for december 5 , 2000 "" let ' s number them all sequentially rather than starting over at each level veronica will call you to coordinate re -

Subject: re : enpower i have not personally talked to james about these issues in enpower . his concerns regarding swaptions and asian options are accurate . it is currently working on new volatility curves for swaptions to use . it is also working on correlations in order for asian options to be valued properly . london trades many more swaptions and asian options than the us ; therefore , the impact of not having swaption volatility curves and correlations is greater to them . the majority of options in the u . s . are european monthly and daily exercises and the current volatility curves adequately take care of these deals . the idea of swaption volatility curves has floated around in the us , but other more material items always got in the way and we continue to use the deal specific volatilities for the swaptions we do have . once the technology is in place to use swaption volatilities we will also adopt . the system was originally built to handle the physical power world that existed in the us and as new markets and new ideas ( such as the us becoming more and more of a financial market ) we will need to enhance enpower to follow suit . swaption vols and asian options are two of these enhancements . also , it is difficult to get option data out of enpower . we have in stage an option sensitivity matrix that , once implemented into production . i will be sure that james knows about . it probably will not solve all his problems , but it will give him a starting place . stacey enron north america corp . from : sally beck 12 / 11 / 2000 11 : 00 am to : stacey w white / hou / ect @ ect cc : subject : enpower in cleaning up e : mails , i ran across this one that i had not yet read . has james called and talke with you about enpower ?

despite the above we have now persuaded the traders to save out newer higher volatilities a week ago and you should have seen a large move up in their var . however , as it stands at the moment they are notable to save out a daily remark as jitendra is saying that he is not happy with their ' model ' / vol curve generator ( i have today asked for a full explanation , details of any testing etc etc and time lines so we can move to getting over this hurdle ) . the swaptions have also not yet had the ticket volatility changed but the impacts are expected to be positive as we are long volatility . i would appreciate your comments on the above as it seems that we are pushing the boundaries here on areas which we really expect to have already been covered in houston some time ago and could do with some help . we are having to use a system which seems to us to have numerous bugs and short comings and are having to spend an enormous amount of it time overcoming the inadequacies of enpower wich i do not think most people are aware of . consequently we have not been able to deliver all the improvements we were required to do in gaining the increased limits so 3 months ago but i would hope you agree that it is not for a lack of trying . sorry it ' s so long but if there are any questions or any perceived inaccuracies in any of the above then please let me know . james	0
Subject: todd hall sally , as you are probably aware the continental power book split project went well but there were a number of areas which were not completed for one reason or another but essentially it did not deliver according to the agreed timetable . todd was instrumental in helping me to drive this forward and was responsible for much of what we achieved . as you may also be aware we had some personnel issues and there have been significant changes in the continental risk management team . we have now recruited a strong manager in coralie evans from csfb and she starts on the 29 th of august . we have also added michelle waldhauser from the houston gas risk management team who arrived on the 7 th of august . there are a number of issues and developments which would greatly benefit from having todd here in london for around a month ( i say around a month as i am guessing within this period he would want to spend some time in oslo pushing the weather risk management area forward ) . attached is a page i put together that cover our immediate needs and why todd is ideally placed to potentially add an enormous amount of value to the continental power business . could we please get together with brent price and mike jordan and discuss whether todd would be available come over . thanks and regards james	0

"Subject: re : trading support operations - london fernley , on january 25 , 1999 , i had breakfast in london with a shaking richard sage who recounted the tail of barry threatening his bonus and employment for doing exactly what jeff skilling told him to do in the previous november . subsequently , richard was "" moved "" from his position and barry promoted . if that is dealing with the situation , this actually reflects on your credibility . if you think that an open communication , independent back office message was sent to the back and middle office in houston and london by virtue of your promotion of barry twice in 12 months , then you are sorely mistaken . on february 2 , 2000 the arthur andersen team , including tom bauer , john sorrells and jim brown stated that barry was an issue in satisfactorily completing the audit tasks from london . i am not sure what we are attempting to accomplish here . you have dismissed my "" advice "" and you need to do what you need to do . if the goal is to get me to change my view , you have a big hole to dig out of . i obviously can ' t change your point of view . i still feel a responsiblity to express the views that i have and others are afraid to surface . it is the inability for people to be heard and feel that they will be supported when they step out on a limb that caused us to lose more money trading than we ever have from a little office in the middle of nowhere . need i go on . let us stop the e - mail wars now . they serve no productive purpose . ted fernley dyson 02 / 09 / 2000 04 : 56 am to : ted murphy / hou / ect @ ect cc : rick buy / hou / ect @ ect , sally beck / hou / ect @ ect , richard causey / corp / enron @ enron subject : re : trading support operations - london ted , we have had discussions about barry in the past and i have followed - up on specific instances you have mentioned - i believe they date back to 1998 and prior to my first hand experience of working with barry throughout 1999 , and the people who raised concerns then acknowledge that the environment has changed since then . we are not so barry - dependent . we have a team of quality risk management professionals as evidenced by the fact that it is the primary recruiting ground for the rac team ( david port , oliver gaylard ) . barry ' s role is much less hands - on now and he is not our candidate for the global products position - this will continue to be kevin sweeney . the role i suggest for barry is the high level co - ordination of the operations team - his energy , enthusiasm and ability to execute on a plan , combined with his considerable institutional knowledge , making a superior candidate difficult to find . frankly , i suggested steve young not for additional depth , but to address the relationship issue that clearly exists - i do not belittle this issue , and while i don ' t think that anyone can point to any "" prosecutable "" offences that barry may have committed in recent history , his management style doesn ' t help to promote the view that he is totally impartial and objective . i will say that he has always been open and frank ( very frank ) with me - indeed if mally and sweeney had been as open we may have had a different story to tell on helsinki . as an aside , i have not been involved in or consulted on the ' world tour ' , although i know that barry suggested this sort of thing to sally a few weeks back . i think it is great that brent price is involved , but we would be happy to contribute staff to this too . regards fernley to : fernley dyson / lon / ect @ ect cc : rick buy , sally beck / hou / ect @ ect subject : re : trading support operations - london fernley , as we discussed earlier this year , i have serious concerns about barry that i think are both well - founded and reasonably well documented . to be fair , i will say that since ql of last year , i have not seen any further "" prosecutable "" offenses and he has made some attempts at being more communicative . however , i am clearly unwilling to stake my career on his transformation , particulary with as influential person as john sherriff in charge of the office . probably more to the point , it continues to concern me that london has not developed an operations team that is not so barry - dependent . evidence to this effect are , the fact that he is your only candidate for the global products position , that someone from houston has to be part of the "" world tour "" in europe ( brent price ) , that your candidates for a senior interim operations head in helsinki was david port or richard sage , and that your suggestion for additional depth is steve young . further for the record , i believe that i am not the only one with whom barry has a credibility issue - arthur andersen , other global products personnell , and other risk people in london have expressed similar concerns to me - i just happen to be the most vocal . ted fernley dyson 02 / 08 / 2000 04 : 07 pm to : richard causey / corp / enron @ enron cc : rick buy / hou / ect @ ect , john sherriff / lon / ect @ ect , ted murphy / hou / ect @ ect , sally beck / hou / ect @ ect subject : trading support operations - london rick , not wishing to delay the comprehensive review of our trading support function , particularly as it relates to our global products business , we already have barry pearce taking a lead in this area . the issue of concern is whether this should be an interim measure or a more permanent solution . well - nothing is permanent in enron and i think barry understands this as well as anybody . if we had a more suitable candidate , we would give him / her the job . i have seen barry develop and mature over the last 12 months along with the team that we have built around him . i ' m convinced that he can add significant value by drawing the global products support functions ' in to the fold ' . however , he clearly has a credibility issue with ted in particular and , whilst i do not share ted ' s views , i do not hold barry out as a saint and i can see recurring problems if such a key relationship is not well grounded . i suggest that we continue to search for a candidate - known and trusted within houston , who can instill confidence there . steve young ( head of rac in london ) may be an interesting option , although i ' m sure he would not be easy to replace . in the meantime we need barry to take things forward and i will be monitoring the situation very closely . regards fernley ."	0

"Subject: your help needed please - cross - commodity reporting please excuse the long e - mail below - i knew we ' d never get a chance to all get together , and this is somewhat urgent as i have to complete the finance committee presentation for the upcoming bod meeting by the end of next week , and it will include trading results for the lst quarter , reported in accordance with the risk management policy . due to issues noted below , this may require immediate attention by your staff as we have a few short days to come up with the best quality numbers we can . i talked to beth already , and mrm met with chris abel ' s group to see if there was a short cut , but our joint conclusion was that the business unit controllers need to be involved in this process as you are the experts on your businesses and can apply the best judgment to decide on the trading results to be reported to the bod . we ' ll probably need to go with our best estimate of 3 / 30 # s as of end of the day next tuesday or wednesday at the latest . as you recall , the february 12 th bod meeting resulted in a clarification that the bod approved trading limits were limits on the generic commodity groups defined , and accordingly the trading results must be reported consistent with that limit structure ( management reporting can be different of course ) . chris abel ' s global energy operations group has prepared a "" rac "" dpr that attempts to aggregate the commodity groups in accordance with the risk management policy , so that top management and the bod can see enron ' s exposure to individual commodities on a consolidated basis . ( a ) this dpr will not impact actual sharing of p / l from a management reporting / business unit perspective - this is purely for market risk management purposes and reporting to the bod . but commercial management will need to review and sign off on the rac dpr and monitor limits accordingly , as these limits are at an enron level . the specific trading results we need for the bod presentation are the first quarter p / l and average daily var , by commodity group . the first rac dpr available is as of 3 / 30 - so while it has cumulative p / l , var is only as of 3 / 30 . ( note - we ' re also comparing to lq 2000 , but we ' re not going to attempt to resolve cross - commodity reporting for that period except at a high level ) . your participation is needed in resolving : 1 ) cross - commodity reporting per the new rac dpr - both retroactively for the lst quarter , and going forward , and 2 ) rovar ( return on average daily var by commodity group ) for the lst quarter . this aggregation of cross - commodity activity has been completed by chris as of 3 / 30 , so he has what he believes to be p / l aggregated for the quarter in accordance with the policy . what we don ' t have is var on a daily basis as the first time it was calculated on an aggregated basis was on 3 / 30 . obviously we ' re not going to be able to go back and calculate daily var for the entire quarter by commodity group aggregated in this new manner - especially within a week . so it appears we ' ll need to "" swag "" average daily var - by reviewing the cross commodity positions aggregated at 3 / 30 , by considering cross - commodity activity you ' re aware of that took place throughout the quarter , and using our best estimate of the impact on var for this cross commodity activity . due to this adjustment in historical reporting practices , we feel a certain level of due diligence is required for us to feel confident we ' re reporting to the bod in accordance with the policy . and since we only have a few days , i thought a team approach to tackling the review would facilitate a prompt resolution of material issues , and then you and chris ' group can work out your processes and procedures on how to handle going forward as you see fit . when you consider materiality , please involve your market risk contact - while a transaction / position / book may not be material to gas or power , it may be material to global products , weather , etc . . would you please help us with the following : ? confirm your review of chris ' aggregation on the rac dpr at 3 / 30 ( chris ' staff can walk you through ) ? are all the cross - commodity positions you ' re aware of being reported correctly ? ? is there other cross - commodity activity not present at 3 / 30 and consequently not aggregated for the quarter ' s results , but actually present during the first quarter and material ? if so , estimate impact on p / l and average daily var . ? we ' re not expecting an exhaustive search or analysis - perhaps you can simply discuss this issue with the traders who handle this type of activity to get a feel , and if they point on specific material transactions , we can address those ; you can determine best approach ? are there certain books in risktrac that have cross - commodity positions imbedded / combined - either held currently or those that generated significant var or p / l during the quarter ? going forward these will need to be reported separately to facilitate risk reporting , but in the next week what we need is an estimate of the impact on the corresponding commodities , or a conclusion that the impact is immaterial . ? once you ' ve reviewed the summary of cross commodity activity per the rac dpr and per your own knowledge , help us estimate the impact on the respective commodities ' average daily var for the quarter - you can discuss with your market risk contact your recommendation on a reasonable "" swag "" approach . after considering the information above , please provide your assessment on whether you are in fact able to capture and report all the cross - commodity activity , and if not , identify the issues involved and whether it is something that market risk needs to address , or if it will simply take more time to resolve the reporting details . if you have other recommendations on how to get comfortable with the trading results for the quarter , please feel free to pursue those . i do not mean to imply i know how to do your jobs , or that you ' re not doing them - i simply want to coordinate with you to ensure the # s we report to the bod are the numbers you agree with , and that if they ' re not completely accurate given recent implementation , that we are able to articulate and estimate the potential misstatement , if any . as you are the experts on your businesses ' results , i simply wanted to make sure i closed the loop with what we in mrm understand regarding your reporting of the cross - commodity activity and trading results and the application of the policy . on a separate note , we need you to identify p / l related to special transactions that flowed through the dpr , but do not really represent trading activity - examples in the past are sfas 125 transactions and other unique gain / loss events - we ' re reporting lq 2001 and lq 2000 , so whatever we can recall about last year will also be considered . we will be sending you a reconciliation from the dpr to the bod package that we use to document any special adjustments , and will discuss this with you to come to an agreement on adjustments to the dpr reporting to derive true trading activity . these adjustments should be minimal , but we ' d like your input to conclude . thank you for your cooperation , regards , cassandra schultz x 30429 713 858 2618 cell 936 321 2185 home ( a ) for example , north american electricity limits represent enron ' s consolidated na electricity trading activity , without regard to which business unit or commodity group actually executes the trades or holds positions . so if power has some gas positions for hedges or other reasons , these gas trades need to be removed from power var and p / l and combined with gas ' var and p / l , etc . . heating oil positions held outside global products should be aggregated with global products ; global products ' positions in gas and power should be aggregated with gas and power , with corresponding adjustment to global products ' results ."	0

( f - pcr ) technology uses live animal blood to detect the presence of infectious diseases and for the development of vaccines for such blood born diseases . it also allows for the efficient , effective , and continuous testing , management and treatment of animal populations . these facts distinguish the technology from any alternative testing and management methodology available to agriculture today - - all of which require the destruction of individual animals and even entire herds . our testing and data analysis processes also allow us not only to separate infected from clean animals , but also to gain knowledge vital to development of preventative vaccines . to date , genethera has successfully developed the assay ability to detect mad cow and chronic wasting disease , a disease affecting elk and deer in north america . diagnostic assays for e . coli ol 57 : h 7 and johnne ' s disease are in the final stages of development . vaccines for e . coli ol 57 : h 7 and johnne ' s disease , both of which are diseases affecting cattle , are in advanced stages of development . in the future , the company plans to expand assay application research to a wide range of diseases / animals , the immediate targets being mad cow , hoof mouth , west nile and newcastle . genethera can detect bse using the companies patented live animal blood test that evaluates the e . d . r . f . gene sequence . the e . d . r . f . gene is proven to decrease dramatically before any tse infection is noticeable in a live animal or human . the patent gtha holds is broad based and can detect all tse diseases including mad cow ( bse ) in cattle , cwd in elk deer and creutzfeld - jacobs in humans the company ' s patented test can detect these diseases faster than any other method developed in the marketplace and at far less a cost . the test can also be used on a mass scale using roche f - pcr , dna analyzing robotics equipment . genethera can analyze over 2000 blood samples a day with one f - pcr machine and a single technician . the project will prove highly profitable at approx $ 4 . 00 per test when wide scale commercialization is under way . a multi - billion dollar , international demand for commercial mad cow testing has emerged around the globe . japan conducted 3 million post - mortem rapid mad cow tests last year alone . they used the western blot developed by prionics ag in swizterland and bio - rad ' s rapid test . costs are between $ 20 and $ 40 dollars per test . most importantly , other tests in the marketplace cannot detect the disease until the animal has been killed . testing through post - mortem brain tissue exams is extremely labor intensive and costly . japan spent between $ 60 million - $ 120 million on 3 million post mortem rapid mad cow tests in 2004 . genethera ' s simple blood test can be collected using their patented field collection system . the sample is then mailed to the lab for testing . the company also stated in their recent 10 k that they are currently in negotiations with strategic testing partners that we believe will absorb the costs of commercializing our live animal mad cow test . management : dr . tony milici -

Subject: [ ilug ] please kindly get back to me from : mr . desmond stevens urgent assistance . you may be surprised to receive this letter from me since you do not know me personally . i am mr . desmond stevens , the first son of dr . dennis stevens , who was recently murdered in the land dispute in zimbabwe . i was furnished with viable information from the world trade centre here in amsterdam , the netherlands and decided to write you . before the death of my father , he had taken me to amsterdam to deposit the sum of ten million , five hundred thousand united states dollars ( us $ 10 , 500 , 000 ) in a security company , as if he foresaw the looming danger in zimbabwe . this money was deposited in a box as gemstones to avoid much demurrage from the security company . this amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the farms and establishment of new farm in swaziland . this land problem came when zimbabwe president mr . robert mugabe , introduced a new land act that wholly affected rich white farmers and some few black farmers . this resulted to the killing and mob action by zimbabwe war veterans and some lunatics in the society . infact , a lot of people were killed because of this land reform act of which my father was one of the victims . it is against this background that my family and i who are currently staying in amsterdam decided to transfer my father  s money to a foreign account . since the law of the netherlands prohibit a refugee ( asylum seeker ) to open any account or to be involved in any financial transaction . as the eldest son of my father , i am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking everything we have got . i am faced with the dilemma of investing this amount of money in the netherlands for the fear of going through the same experience in future since both countries have similar history . moreover , the netherlands foreign exchange policy does not allow such investment from asylum seekers . as a businessman , whom i have entrusted my future and my family in his hands , i must let you know that this transaction is risk free . if you accept to assist me and my family , all i need you to do for me is to make arrangement and come to amsterdam , the netherlands so that you can open the non - resident account which will aid us in transferring the money into any account you will nominate overseas . this money i intend to use for investment . i have options to offer you , first you can choose to have certain percentage of the money for nominating your account for the transaction , or you can go into partnership with me for a proper profitable investment of the money in your country . whichever option you choose , feel free to notify me . i have mapped out 5 % of this money for all expenses incurred in processing this transaction . if you do not prefer a partnership , i am willing to give you 25 % of the money while the remaining 70 % that is meant for me , will be for the investment in your country . please , contact me with the above telephone and e - mail address , while i implore you to maintain the absolute secrecy required in the transaction . yours faithfully , desmond stevens . - - irish linux users ' group : ilug @ linux . ie http : / / www . linux . ie / mailman / listinfo / ilug for ( un ) subscription information . list maintainer : listmaster @ linux . ie	1

"Subject: judicial judgements - child support bgs  you for your interest ! judgment courses offers an extensive training course in "" how to collect moneyjudgments "" if you are like many people , you are not even sure what a money judgment is and why processing money judgments can earn you very substantial income . if you ever sue a company or a person and you win then you will have a money judgment against them . you are happy you won but you will soon find out the shocking fact : its now up to you to collect on the judgment . the court does not require the loser to pay you . the court will not even help you . you must trace the loser down , find their assets , their employment , bank accounts , real estate , stocks and bonds , etc . very few people know how to find these assets or what to do when they are found . the result is that millions of judgments are just sitting in files and being forgotten . in 79 % of the cases the winner of a judgment never sees a dime . the non - payment of judicial debt has grown to epidemic proportions . right now in the united states there is between 200 and 300 billion dollars of uncollectedmoney judgment debt . for every judgment that is paid , 5 more judgments take its place . we identified this massive market 8 years ago and have actively pursued judicial judgments since . we invented this business . we have perfected it into a well proven and solid profession in which only a select few will be trained in the techniques necessary to succeed . with our first hand experience we have built a course which teaches you how to start your business in this new unknown and exciting field of processing money judgments . by following the steps laid out in our course and with reasonable effort you can become very successful in the processing of money judgments . the income potential is substantial in this profession . we have associates who have taken our course and are now working full time making $ 96 , 000 . 00 to over $ 200 , 000 . 00 per year . part time associates are earning between $ 24 , 000 . 00 and $ 100 , 000 . 00 per year . some choose to operateout of their home and work by themselves . others build a sizable organization of 15 to 25 people in attractive business offices . today our company and our associates have over 126 million dollars in money judgments that we are currently processing . of this 126 million , 25 million is in the form of joint ventures between our firm and our associates . joint ventures are where we make our money . we only break even when our course is purchased . we make a 12 % margin on the reports we supply to our associates . our reporting capability is so extensive that government agencies , police officers , attorneys , credit agencies etc . , all come to us for reports . many of our associates already have real estate liens in force of between 5 million to over 15 million dollars . legally this means that when the properties are sold or refinanced our associate must be paid off . the norm is 10 % interest compounded annually on unpaid money judgments . annual interest on 5 million at 10 % translates to $ 500 , 000 . 00 annually in interest income , not counting the payment of the principal . our associates earn half of this amount or $ 250 , 000 . 00 per year . this is just for interest , not counting principle and not counting the compounding of the interest which can add substantial additional income . typically companies are sold for 10 times earnings . just based on simple interest an associate with 5 million in real estate liens could sell their business for approximately 2 . 5 million dollars . 92 % of all of our associates work out of their home ; 43 % are women and 36 % are part time . one of the benefits of working in this field is that you are not under any kind of time frame . if you decide to take off for a month on vacation then go . the judgments you are working on will be there when you return . the judgments are still in force , they do not disappear . the way we train you is non - confrontational . you use your computer and telephone to do most of the processing . you never confront the debtor . the debtor doesn ' t know who you are . you are not a collection agency . simply stated the steps to successful money processing are as follows : mail our recommended letter to companies and individuals with money judgments . ( we train you how to find out who to write to ) 8 % to 11 % of the firms and people you write will call you and ask for your help . they call you , you don ' t call them unless you want to . you send them an agreement ( supplied in the course ) to sign which splits every dollar you collect 50 % to you and 50 % to them . this applies no matter if the judgment is for $ 2 , 000 . 00 or $ 2 , 000 , 000 . 00 . you then go on - line to our computers to find the debtor and their assets . we offer over 120 powerful reports to assist you . they range from credit reports from all three credit bureaus , to bank account locates , employment locates , skip traces and locating stocks and bonds , etc . the prices of our reports are very low . typically 1 / 2 to 1 / 3 of what other firms charge . for example we charge $ 6 . 00 for an individuals credit report when some other companies charge $ 25 . 00 . once you find the debtor and their assets you file garnishments and liens on the assets you have located . ( standard fill in the blanks forms are included in the course ) when you receive the assets you keep 50 % and send 50 % to the original judgment holder . once the judgment is fully paid you mail a satisfaction of judgment to the court . ( included in the course ) quote ' s from several of our students : thomas in area code 516 writes us : "" i just wanted to drop you a short note thanking you for your excellent course . my first week , part time , will net me 3 , 700 . 00 dollars . your professionalism in both the manual and your support . you have the video opened doors for me in the future . there ' s no stopping me now . recently thomas states he has over $ 8 , 500 , 000 worth of judgments he is working on "" after only having this course for four months , larry s . in area code 314 stated to us : "" i am now making $ 2 , 000 . 00 per week and expect this to grow to twice this amountwithin the next year . i am having a ball . i have over $ 250 , 000 in judgments i am collecting on now "" after having our course for 7 months larry s . in 314 stated "" i am now making $ 12 , 000 . 00 per month and have approximately $ 500 , 000 . 00 in judgments i am collecting on . looks like i will have to hire someone to help out "" marshal in area code 407 states to us "" i feel bad , you only charged me $ 259 . 00 for this course and it is a goldmine . i have added 3 full time people to help me after only having your course for 5 months "" > from the above information and actual results you can see why we can state the following : with our course you can own your own successful business . a business which earns you substantial income now and one which could be sold in 3 - 5 years , paying you enough to retire on and travel the world . a business which is extremely interesting to be in . a business in which every day is new and exciting . none of your days will be hum - drum . your brain is challenged . a business , which protects you from corporate downsizing . a business which you can start part time from your home and later , if you so desire , you can work in full time . a business , which is your ticket to freedom from others telling you what to do . a business , which lets you control your own destiny . our training has made this happen for many others already . make it happen for you ! if the above sounds interesting to you then its time for you to talk to a real live human being , no cost or obligation on your part . please call us at 1 - 2 ` 8 ` 1 - 5 ` 0 ` 0 - 4 ` 0 ` 1 ` 8 . we have service support staff available to you from 8 : 00 am to 10 : 00 pm ( central time ) 7 days a week . if you callthis number you can talk to one of our experienced customer support personnel . they can answer any questions you may have - with no obligation . sometimes we run special pricing on our courses and combinations of courses . when you call our customer support line they can let you know of any specials we may be running . if you like what you read and hear about our courses , then the customer support person can work with you to place your order . we are very low key . we merely give you the facts and you can then decide if you want to work with us or not . thank you for your time and interest . + + + + + this ad is produced and sent out by : uas to be e r a s e d from our mailing list please email us at smiley 82 @ 168 city . com with "" e r a s e "" in the sub - line or write us at : adminscript - update , p o b 1 2 0 0 , o r a n g e s t a d , a r u b a + + + + + + { % rand % } , , , , , , , , , , to 48 6 - 03 c 29 p my heart and my soul are lifted to you . i offer my life to you everything i ' ve been through use it for your glory .

"" , i have to blush & say . . . persistence and personality . of course , i always follow the advice with my own little disclaimer : what makes me successful may not work the same for you . . . & your first lesson is to get over the deep - seeded idea that success - of any kind , in my opinion - is somehow an unknown , unattainable secret . clearly , it is not . it ' s not unknown . it ' s not unattainable . it ' s not years of digging to find the "" secrets "" to internet riches . one thing that "" gets to me "" so often in my work as an internet consultant , author and internet success strategist is that so many people on the net seem to have this incredibly huge mental block that stands between themselves and success on the net . it ' s almost as if they ' ve been barraged by so many claims of what works and what doesn ' t work , and so many long , complicated routes to actually succeeding in their online venture , that "" success "" is the equivelant of a 100 - foot high brick wall . it ' s not that difficult , my friends ! it is not that complicated ! ! long - time friend and business associate rick beneteau has a new ebook out called branding you & breaking the bank . get it ! ! http : / / www . roibot . com / bybb . cgi ?

it doesn ' t exist . there ' s nothing there to fear to begin with . . . get over it ! ! what i ' m telling you is , the only thing standing between you and the success you most desire . . . is yourself . when you realize this , you will tear down that brick wall by means of complete and instantaneous disintegration . it will no longer exist * in your mind * , which is the only "" real "" place it ever was anyhow ! yes , "" persistence and personality "" inherently includes honesty , integrity , accountability , and many other qualities but you also have to hone in on your ultimate goals and realize that probably the most valuable , powerful key to your success . . . is you ! that may be the most incredible "" secret "" we ever uncover in our lifetime ! and , trust me , that brick wall won ' t ever get in your way again . . . unless you let it . talk about simple ! ! bryan is a "" veteran "" internet consultant , author , internet success strategist & marketer . he publishes mega - success . com chronicles to over 11 , 500 subscribing members , authors articles which appear all over the net , and helps hundreds of wealth - hungry people in their journey to internet success . bryan is also director of his no bs guerrilla internet marketing group at http : / / . com & a fantastic new joint venture partners program for that site . bryan hall is a founding member and the development consultant for the prestigious icop ( tm ) at http : / / www . i - cop . org / 1016 . htm you can reach bryan at 877 . 230 . 3267 or by emailing him directly at bryan . hall @ mega - success . com = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = member showcase = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = examine carefully - those with email addresses included will trade links with you . . . you are encouraged to contact them . there are many ways to build a successful business - just look at these successful sites programs other members are involved in . . . get insane amounts of traffic to your website . purchase 10 , 000 guaranteed visitors to your site and receive 5 , 000 free . more traffic = more money ! less than 2 cents a visitor . space is limited . order now ! http : / / www . freepicklotto . com trade links - businessopps @ aol . com stop smoking - free lesson ! ! discover the secret to stopping smoking . to master these powerful techniques , come to http : / / www . breath - of - life . net for your free lesson . act now ! p . s . tell someone you care about . trade links - jturco 3 @ hotmail . com celebration sale ! $ 99 . 00 on casinos / sportsbetting sites , lingerie stores , gift stores , adult sites toy stores . mention ad # bmlm 99 to receive this special sale price . order now ! http : / / www . cyberopps . com / ?

( gtts ) be the next stock to rock ? recently , we read an article in the economist that highlighted online gaming and how it has become a socially acceptable form of entertainment . over the next few days , as we thought about what sort of impact this trend could have , we started to notice that online gambling was being discussed all over the media - in newspapers , online and on television . it became obvious to us that more and more people were jumping on the internet to bet on games . we also came across some staggering statistics . merrill lynch , for example , has predicted that gambling has the potential to account for a full 1 % of global economic activity ! another source , ecommercetimes . com , recently reported that the scope of this business is so enormous that some have even claimed that it is the single most important factor in the growth of e - commerce . the online gaming industry , in other words , appears to be booming , and it may be an ideal time to is time to invest . we decided to find out who the key players were in the business . after speaking with a number of industry insiders , the trail led us to an emerging , publicly traded company called gaming transactions inc . ( ggts ) . after a close look at ggts , we decided that this company could produce huge returns on investment in the upcoming months . although ggts is a new company , it has some surprisingly experienced players at the helm an uncommon thing to find in an industry only ten years old . the company has come out with online versions of the addictive game keno . and its management team was smart enough to secure the rights to the keno . com website , which , if youre marketing keno , is as good as it gets . keno has the widest spread for the house of any mainstream gambling game . ggts is also about to launch a suite of other online gambling games , including poker and sports - book betting . once it offers these popular games , and given that it already has keno . com online , the company could bring in great revenues , attracting a lot of attention in the investment community and driving up its stock price . after a successful north american launch , gaming transactions inc . ( gtts ) has translated its games into chinese and is about to hit asia . this initiative looks like a wise business decision : many analysis anticipate that china will be the biggest source of online gambling revenue by 2007 , so the company could be poised for massive expansion in terms of both profits and global reach . what does all this tell us ? a brand new company , a popular , well - known game , one of the biggest spreads for the house , a growing market , experienced management , and a stock price that is trading under a dollar it adds up to the potential for huge gains for early investors . if youre interested in more information on the market and gaming transactions inc . , click here to read a free ten - page report . . . to join market movers mailings http : / / ggtsstock . com to find out more . first source data inc . 4535 west sahara ave # 217 las vegas nevada 89102 disclosure and disclaimer investment news indepth reports ( hereinafter inir ) , operated by first source data , inc .

Subject: panda ranks famous people used to spread computer viruses panda software ranks famous people most often used to spread computer viruses a coordinated attack with four species of malware featuring an image of michael jackson marks a resurgence in the use of famous names to distribute malware on the internet . the recent distribution of a new type of malware , detected by panda software as downloader . dbr , by mass mailing messages to users around the world and using a spoof story about a suicide attempt by michael jackson , is nothing more than a new episode in social engineering : exploiting the popularity of certain celebrities to increase the propagation of this type of threat . the strategy used to spread this malware is actually quite complex : the message , which has been distributed manually as spam across the internet , contains a link to web page . this page , by means of an example of malware detected by panda software as phel . j , exploits a browser vulnerability to insert inor . ak , an html application , on computers . this in turn provides the access needed to install downloader . dbr on the user ' s computer . however the malicious chain doesn ' t end there . once installed on computers , this trojan downloads the au variant of the dedler worm , which actually takes the malicious action on the infected computer . this is not the first time that michael jackson has been used as bait to distribute this kind of threat : last november a mail was distributed supposedly containing a link to a website from which users could download a video of jackson with a child . this video did not exist , but instead a trojan was downloaded onto the computer . even though it is not usual for such complex coordinated techniques to be used to install malware on computers , the names of celebrities are frequently used to distribute mails which either contain malware attached to the mail itself ( often camouflaged as an image ) , or which contain a url where the malware is accessed ( as in this case ) . trojans in themselves do not generally have the capacity to propagate ( as worms do ) , and so this type of strategy is needed for the message to spread . at the top of this particular celebrity virus ranking is britney spears , who , according to data from pandalabs , has been the involuntary protagonist of most attacks over the last years . attractive female celebrities are often used for these purposes as the excuse for sending the mail is often to entice users with the promise of interesting photos . along these lines , third and fourth respectively in the ranking come jennifer lopez ( unfortunately associated to the famous loveletter ) and shakira . porn stars are also often used for this purpose . the second person most frequently used by malware creators to distribute their works is microsoft owner , bill gates , and fifth in the list is osama bin laden . the latter has been the subject of e - mails claiming that he has been hung , or finally caught , and the spread of these messages increased after the iraq war . other famous people who have been used in this context include anna kournikova , who was the subject of a widespread example of malware bearing her name , bill clinton , pamela anderson , and even alberto fujimori , the former president of peru . the ranking of famous people most frequently used is : position name britney spears bill gates jennifer lopez shakira osama bin laden michael jackson bill clinton anna kournikova paris hilton pamela anderson to prevent infection from these and other malicious code , panda software advises users to keep their antivirus software updated . panda software customers already have the updates at their disposal to detect and disinfect this new malicious code . to help as many users as possible scan and / or disinfect their computers when necessary , panda software offers panda activescan , which now also detects spyware , free of charge at www . pandasoftware . com . webmasters who would like to include activescan on their websites can get the html code , free of charges , at www . pandasoftware . com / partners / webmasters . panda software also offers users virus alerts , an e - bulletin in english and spanish that gives immediate warning of the emergence of potentially dangerous malicious code . to receive virus alerts just visit panda software ' s website ( www . pandasoftware . com ) and complete the corresponding form in the virus alerts section . for more information about these and other malicious code , visit panda software ' s virus encyclopedia at : panda software 230 n . maryland ave . , ste . 303 glendale , ca 91209 this e - mail message is an advertisement and / or solicitation . 	1

Subject: ground breaking investor news another ground breaking news alert from nwwv . a ground floor opportunity for investors - an explosive , hyper - growth online auction e - commerce company . newave surpasses $ 1 million in monthly revenue ! nwwv is an online auction and e - commerce company which utilizes the internet to maximize profits and savings for it ' s customers recent headlines newave surpasses $ 1 million in record monthly revenue surpassing the one million dollar monthly revenue milestone is a significant achievement in our relatively short history . we are now beginning to experience contribution to our top line from all three operating subsidiaries , onlinesupplier . com , auctionliquidator and discount online warehouse . i believe that given the positive industry outlook , we will continue to experience significant growth as we further develop and integrate the three businesses into one unique and total ecommerce solution . newave ceo michael hill newave launches nationwide advertising campaign with it ' s spokesman bob eubanks television and game show personality bob eubanks , will be featured on multiple television interviews nationwide the interviews are part of a broader national advertising campaign to be followed later this summer with the broadcast of newave ' s inaugural infomercial featuring mr . eubanks . newave ' s ' auctionliquidator ' to manage initial major online ebay charity auction by converging the power of online commerce with philanthropy , we believe we have the ability to develop this concept into a force within the fundraising industry . having recently surpassed over 1 , 000 successful online auctions processed through auctionliquidator , we believe we have just begun to tap into a potentially vast market which is estimated to be approximately $ 10 billion . - christa frankos , vp auctionliquidator newave ' s onlinesupplier . com partners with listen up overflow call center ; expect surge in call volume sales we currently receive approximately 6 - 7 , 000 inbound calls a day at onlinesupplier . com . we expect that number to increase to between 10 - 15 , 000 a day with the launch of our infomercial . michael hill , newave ceo newave ' s ' auctionliquidator ' auctions $ 90 , 000 ' jesse james west coast chopper . auctionliquidator will auction a custom built cherry cfl west coast chopper . the bike is personally autographed by discovery channel ' s monster garage show host jesse james and is 100 % hand made the auction will be listed on ebay through its affiliated non - profit provider missionfish . the retail value of the chopper is approximately $ 90 , 000 and typically buyers have an estimated one year wait . the auction bidding will begin at $ 50 , 000 on june 8 th and close on june 18 th . we believe that our offering is a new and unique option for non profit organizations to raise donations and our stated mission is to become the new standard in non profit fundraising . christa frankos vp auctionliquidator newave announces record annual revenue for 12 months ended december 31 , 2004 we are extremely pleased to have generated almost $ 7 million in revenue in just our first full calendar year of business . . . we are continuing to experience a surge in new memberships to onlinesupplier . com and believe we can effect full scale launches of both auctionliquidator . com and discount online warehouse this year . additionally , with the nationwide broadcast of our first infomercial featuring our celebrity spokesman bob eubanks scheduled for july , we should effectively begin national branding of the newave concept and become a step closer to achieving our mission of providing a fully integrated e - commerce solution for the marketplace . nwwvthe total e - commerce solution nwwv through its 3 subsidiaries utilizes the internet to maximize the income potential and substantial discounted savings for its customers onlinesupplier . com offers organizations of all sizes from home business to large enterprise the ability to create , manage , and maintain effective website solutions for e - commerce since inception in august of 2003 , onlinesupplier . com has serviced over 150 , 000 paid members and received over 2 million inquiries regarding its services ! auctionliquidator is an online portal which provides individuals , enterprise customers and non - profit organizations with a quick and efficient method for selling unwanted items on ebay and other online auction sites since its recent launch , auctionliquidator has surpassed over 1 , 000 successful auctions ! discount online warehouse is an online wholesale club which offers discounted products purchased in bulk quantities to its members challenge : while the u . s . economy has been sluggish , e - commerce has never been hotter ! according to forrester research , u . s . retail e - commerce sales eclipsed $ 136 . 6 billion in 2004 , an increase of 20 % from 2003 . put another way : e - commerce grew three times faster than retail sales as a whole for the same period ! but there is a dark cloud on the horizon . there are more than 22 million small businesses in the u . s . , the vast majority with fewer than a dozen employees . they represent 50 % of the entire u . s . economy and 75 % of all new jobs . . . and yet these businesses find it increasingly difficult to cash in on the e - commerce revolution . it ' s becoming harder and harder to design and maintain online stores . . . set up merchant accounts . . . control web - based inventories . . . and package and ship products . as consumers increasingly demand web catalogs and instant online shopping , millions of small businesses are missing out . without a state of the art web site . . . a wide variety of competitively - priced products and services . . . and cutting - edge ordering and payment options . . . these small businesses and entrepreneurs are losing billions of dollars in potential profits . and because small businesses provide most of the new jobs in america , the ripple effect of this failure to offer online shopping could dramatically slow down the economic recovery of the country as a whole . plus , that ' s only half of the problem . there are millions more people and businesses that would like to sell items on ebay . . . but they either don ' t own computers or don ' t want to be bothered with listing and photographing items on ebay . . nwwv has the ultimate solution fortunately , nwwv has developed easy , cost - effective solutions to these e - commerce challenges ! first : nwwv , through its web portal online supplier . com , helps small businesses and entrepreneurs get in on the e - commerce revolution by providing a turn key online store with dynamic content . . . hundreds of products selling at up to 50 % below retail price . . . access to merchant account services . . . and direct shipping to buyers . for a small monthly fee , nwwv allows businesses to have an instant online retail presence . second : nwwv ' s other subsidiary , auction liquidator , has established a relationship with fedex to provide it with nationwide network of drop - off centers that will let anyone to sell an item on ebay by just dropping it off at any one of the 5 , 000 fedex or kinkos locations without ever touching a computer . auctionliquidator will handle the entire transaction for the seller and simply send him or her a check once the item sells . nwwv recently launched a national radio advertising campaign featuring celebrity spokesman bob eubanks , longtime tv host of the newlywed game and well - known music impresario . nwwv is currently in production for their first infomercial which is scheduled for nationwide broadcast beginning in july 2005 . legendary tv game show host and celebrity personality bob - eubanksof the newlywed game now national spokesman for nwwv 7 big reasons to consider nwwv before its stock could jump from $ 1 . 50 a share to $ 15 1 . nwwv has innovated the e - commerce industry : as a one - stop online wholesaler and e - commerce facilitator , nwwv helps thousands of entrepreneurs and small businesses take advantage of the explosion in online shopping and auctioneering . according to forrester research , e - commerce sales will hit $ 175 billion this year and $ 310 billion by 2010 and nwwv is smack dab in the middle of it . 2 . nwwv ' s online auction drop - off concept could bring in millions of more auction customers and capture a significant portion of a potential $ 10 billion market . ebay itself estimates that several million people would like to sell items on its service but don ' t know how to use computers . a company like nwwv that has established a drop - off presence with fedex and already has an established online auction wholesale business could become the dominant player in a brand - new , growth segment of e - commerce . 3 . nwwv ' s growth has been nothing short of explosive . within three months of its launch in august 2003 , nwwv had monthly sales of $ 348 , 000 . for 2004 nwwv just reported annual sales of $ 6 . 8 million in just their first full calendar year of business and just announced it surpassed over $ 1 million in monthly sales ! 4 . like ebay and ubid , nwwv ' s growth potential is virtually unlimited . a tiny web site with just the right combination of e - commerce solutions and products can grow at an exponential rate . already , nwwv has serviced more than 150 , 000 paid members . . . and is receiving over 6 , 000 new online inquires per day . if only 1 % of them join the nwwv online shopping club , nwwv would triple its rate of growth . 5 . nwwv ' s monthly fee of $ 29 . 95 per month guarantees a steady flow of revenue . this guarantees the company a source of revenue for its ongoing marketing campaigns . as an online wholesale shopping club , nwwv also makes money from sales of the top - quality products offered through its web portal , onlinesupplier . com . 6 . nwwv recently launched a national radio advertising campaign featuring celebrity spokesman bob eubanks , longtime tv host of the newlywed game and well - known music impresario . nwwv is also currently in production for their first infomercial which is scheduled for nationwide broadcast beginning in july 2005 . 7 . by my calculations , nwwv would only need increase annual sales ten - fold to $ 68 million for its stock to potentially skyrocket from $ 1 . 50 a share today to $ 15 a share . it ' s risky , but would turn every $ 10 , 000 invested into almost $ 100 , 000 . if the current growth continues , nwwv could potentially meet sales numbers like that in 24 months or less . is it possible for a new company like nwwv to grow that fast ? you better believe it ! annual sales of $ 68 million represent only a miniscule portion just 0 . 05 % of the $ 136 billion in total e - commerce sales . . . which are growing at the staggering rate of 20 % per year . dear investor : the only sure path to investment wealth is to find breakthrough new companies before anyone else does and buy them when they ' re still dirt cheap . in this special issue , i am blowing the lid on nwwv a brand - new e - commerce company that is in the process of revolutionizing the burgeoning online auction market . it ' s an online shopping club that lets ordinary people set up , maintain and grow their own auction businesses for just pennies a day . and according to forrester research , this year online auctions will represent fully 25 % of a $ 175 billion e - commerce market . read this report and you will discover why i believe nwwv could turn a $ 10 , 000 investment into $ 100 , 000 within just 24 months or sooner ! but don ' t delay . this company already has 150 , 000 members . . . its first calendar year annual sales hit almost $ 7 million ! . . . and is still growing this stock has the potential to be a huge winner . don ' t miss out ! read this valuable special report right away ! sincerely , jack burney , editor welcome to this issue of hitech fortunes ! i don ' t think i ' ve ever been more excited about a stock and that ' s saying a lot . i won ' t kid you , either : this is one of those stocks that may scare off some investors , but which has the potential to make you , not 5 times your money , but 10 or even 20 times your money . it ' s risky , but with potential profits like those , i think it ' s a risk you should consider . back in 1995 , two guys got together in a san jose , california , living room to discuss launching a new online shopping business . they didn ' t want to sell products themselves , like the new company amazon . com . they simply wanted to help people and businesses sell their products to one another . the new web site would make its money from a small upfront fee for using the service . . . and a small percentage of the price of the products sold on the site ( between 1 % and 5 % , depending upon the price ) . most people , of course , thought pierre omi - dyar and jeff skoll were crazy . when their company first went public , its stock only sold for $ 3 a share . talk about a small stock ! but a year later , no one thought they were crazy . every $ 10 , 000 invested in ebay grew into $ 166 , 000 in 12 months . and after just nine years in business , ebay today has 100 million registered users , a total market cap of $ 52 billion and annual net revenues in excess of $ 3 billion . i only bring this up to remind you of the astonishing potential of the right e - commerce stock . quite frankly , most of them never get off the ground . the dot . com bust taught us that a bright idea is not enough , that you have to have a solid business plan and substantial growth in revenues to create a winner . but when you do find a winner , the profits you can make are simply outstanding . the company i am going to introduce to you in this issue is just such a breakthrough e - commerce stock . it has the potential to become another huge winner . it is the first company i know of to combine the concepts of wholesale shopping clubs and drop - off consignment stores with the exponential power of e - commerce and internet auctions . like ebay , it makes its money both from membership fees as well as from a percentage of the actual sales on its web sites and through its drop - off consignment stores . and its sales are growing at a rate of more than 21 % . . . per month . i ' ve seen just how fast an e - commerce business can take off when it has the right concept at the right time . i believe this new stock is just such a company . get ready for yet another potential huge winner !

Subject: good day friend dear friend , my name is salim ibrahim a merchant in dubai , in the u . a . e . i have been diagnosed with esophageal cancer it has defiled all forms of medical treatment , and right now i have only about a few months to live , according to medical experts . i have not particularly lived my life so well , as i never really cared for anyone ( not even myself ) but my business . though i am very rich , i was never generous , i was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as that was the only thing i cared for . but now i regret all this as i now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world . i believe when god gives me a second chance to come to this world i would live my life a different way from how i have lived it . now that god has called me , i have willed and given most of my property and assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as a few close friends . i want god to be merciful to me and accept my soul so , i have decided to give also to charity organizations , as i want this to be one of the last good deeds i do on earth . so far , i have distributed money to some charity organizations in the u . a . e , algeria and malaysia . now that my health has deteriorated so badly , i cannot do this myself anymore . i once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which i have there to charity organization in bulgaria and pakistan , they refused and kept the money to themselves . hence , i do not trust them anymore , as they seem not to be contended with what i have left for them . the last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of ( twenty million five hundred thousand u . s dollars ) that i have with a finance / security company abroad . i will want you to help me collect this consignment and dispatched it to charity organizations . i have set aside 15 % for you . god be with you . salim ibrahim note : please do get back to me via my private email address at ibrahim _ salim @ ny . com becuase i do not want my family to know anything about this project , so i could give you the full details about the funds . please endeavour to get back to me via my specified private email address . thanks for understanding . may the almighty allah bless you abondantly . mail enviado desde el servicio webmail en el sitio | * btw * | call of duty - . . /	1

"" this reader will know that in 2005 , only lavender sweet peas produced flowers . that "" fact "" will disappear unless it ' s in my journal . i ' m going to press flowers between the pages , a snapshot of my garden , maybe a bit of poetry , a photograph of my welsh terrier , buttons . i will add garden - variety quotes to stir me and thoughts i cannot do without . what will i write ? what will you write ? i ' m a simple person and will scribble , "" today i ' ve started this garden journal . with paper and pen i will tell myself about my garden . "" it ' s my hope you write about the breezes on your face , the soil on your fingers and the sunshine on your back , among other miracles . i pray you ' ll take up gardening with pen in hand . - - eva shaw , ph . d . eva is a woman who lives to write , garden and mentor . she teaches writing online , speaks nationally on grief and recovery and is the author of the just released , what to do when a loved one dies : a practical and compassionate guide for dealing with death on life ' s terms . from our mailbag : ( in response to last week ' s story , only winners ) dear heartwarmers : two great stories . keep them coming . - - pat dear heartwarmers : thank you for another wonderful heartwarmer . hope she realizes this was one kid who had an imagination ! blessings . - - jene dear heartwarmers : hey , pat and his invisible baseball is such an amazingly beautiful story . there ' s something very basic in our human nature that makes us connect in an invisible way . i only wish politicians wouldn ' t spoil it all with their ridiculous fake rhetoric spewing "" divide and rule "" policies . sorry , i couldn ' t help that after the bomb blasting news from everywhere , not just london . - - chhanda dear heartwarmers : i have a daughter with down ' s syndrome and loud noises bother her also . at our church there is a section where a group of down ' s sit . it is interesting to note that when the preaching or music gets louder , they begin to cover up their ears . - - robert dear heartwarmers : although i haven ' t expressed my opinion about one of your stories for quite some time - - even though there have been many good ones - - i feel compelled to comment on this one . as a person with several disabilities , including blindness , i couldn ' t agree more that when we show friendship and compassion , everybody wins . if ours was a world in which more of those inclusive and receptive attitudes were shown , perhaps it would be a kinder , gentler world . thanks for an excellent story which mirrored the best that we can be when we put our minds , hearts , and souls to it . - - terri do you enjoy heartwarmers ?

Subject: assistance from : ahmed seiko email : ahmed _ se @ arabtop . net dubai - uae dear friend , i am ahmed from zaire , presently known as democratic republic of congo . i am the son of late maramotto sese seiko , the former central bank governor , during the regime of his immediate senior brother , late president mobutu sese seiko of zaire , republic of congo . i got your contact from chambers of commerce and industry here in dubai . as a result of my discrete search for a reliable foreign partner , i am delighted to confront you based on a profile conviction about your experience in investment programmed . i now decided to write you as well as to let you know that i need your assistance in helping me to invest my money . in fact , i left my country with a reasonable amount of money , which belongs to my late father during the time of war in my country when the present government , controlled by president laurent kabila , who sent my uncle away from the presidential seat , and my father was shot by the rebels , i managed to leave the country with the sum of ( us . $ 14 , 000 , 000 . 00 ) fourteen million dollars , which is with me here in dubai , in cash as well . hoping you will respond to my call to assist me in investing this money , because i am totally ignorant of investment and i was in school when the war broke out in my country . for your assistance and co - operation , i have decided to bequeath to you , 15 % of the total sum involved and 5 % mapped out for any miscellaneous expenses that we may incur during the process of transferring this money to your country . moreover , it is risk free in the sense that i have taken proper care of all the formalities regarding to this transaction . i am presently 26 years of age and should not be expected to withdraw this fund from the security firm where it was deposited for safekeeping till i am convinced that you can accommodate the money . the bottom line is that we need to meet here in dubai to arrange on the relocation of the funds to your country . items on the things i want are : 1 . helping me to bank the money in a safe account . 2 . help me to get residential papers and giving me directions as to what to invest on . please reply me on this email address ( ahmed _ se @ arabtop . net ) as soon as you receive my message to enable me finalize with the security company , where i deposited it for safekeeping . best regards , ahmed sese seiko	1

( ii ) 70 % for us ( the panel officials ( iii ) 10 % to be used in settling all expenses ( by both you and us ) incidental to the actualization of this project . we wish to invest our share of the proceeds of this project in foreign stock markets and other business till we are ready and able to have access to them without raising any eyebrows here at home . please note that this transaction is 100 % safe and risk - free . we intend to effect the transfer within fourteen ( 14 ) banking days from the date of receipt of the following information through the fax number stated above _ - : your bank ' s name , company  s name , address , telephone and fax numbers and the account number into which the funds should be paid . the above information will enable us write letters of claim and job description respectively . this way , we will use your company  s name to apply for the payment and backdate the award of the contract to your company . we are looking forward to doing this transaction with you and we solicit for your utmost confidentiality in this transaction . please acknowledge the receipt of this letter using my direct telephone number 234 1775 5791 and my america internet fax number 240 744 0416 or 801 516 7986 only . it was acquired for the purpose of confidentiality . i will bring you into a more detailed picture of this transaction when i hear from you . best regards , ben kokori	1
